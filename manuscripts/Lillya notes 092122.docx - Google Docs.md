​The Shadow of Lillya​
​Notes from Audrey Berger​
​September 21, 2022​
​Characters​
​Lillya - This is the story of Lillya Englehart, a​​talented horse woman of Imperial Russia​
​who survives revolution, famine and war. Her father was born into wealth and married​
​into the aristocracy and it’s attendant problems. She is introduced to the court of Czar​
​Nicholas II and becomes a favorite of the royal family.​
​Lillya grows up in a charmed life, as described in the early chapters. She is a celebrity​
​circus performer and favorite of the Czarina. She teaches riding to the Czar’s family.​
​She befriends a very talented ballet dancer named Katya who has a daughter named​
​Donatalia who is also a ballet dancer at the Imperial School a few years younger than​
​Lillya’s son Vladimir. She becomes worried about the fate of Russia and sends her son​
​Vladimir and the Vronsky family circus to America in early 1905 following the 1905​
​revolution. During the next 12 years she becomes even closer to the Czarina and her​
​children – teaching them riding and being a frequent guest at the several palaces. She​
​flees Petrograd in 1917 with her husband Anton. Anton is killed and Lillya is taken​
​prisoner by the Red army and is taken to Peter and Paul prison where she is jailed for​
​some period of time.​
​In prison, she hears about the October revolution and the ascendency of the​
​Bolsheviks. When she learns that the Czar and his family have been killed by the​
​communists she is grief stricken and mortified.​
​She narrowly survives the revolution and afterwards is befriended by her old circus​
​colleagues. She continues to work in the circus community and teaches riding during​
​the period of communist rule. In the 1920’s and 1930’s she spends some more time in​
​prison or in a gulag. During the 1930’s she makes amends with Natasha who, over the​
​course of time, has changed her views about the communists and the monarchy.​
​Natasha helps her escape Russia. She comes to the USA in 1941, meets her​
​grandchildren and makes peace with Herve. The theme of her later life will be​
​reconciliation with Natasha, Herve, the revolution and the czar.​
​Natasha - Natasha (surname TBD) grows up as a servant/companion of Lillya in the​
​wealthy family of Yuri and Angelika Englehart. She was born to Angelika’s maid as a​
​result of an affair between the maid and Michael, Yuri’s cousin. She is the same age as​
​Lillya, but is sent away to Odessa by Yuri at age 16 because he doesn’t want this secret​
​bastard cousin to be part of Lillya’s emerging adult life. Natasha matures with her​
​mother in Odessa, learns from her mother that Yuri’s cousin Michael is her father but is​
​warned not to tell Lillya about this. Perhaps Michael visits and supports the young​
​Natasha because she is his only child. We need to learn more about Natasha’s mother​
​– her name and background in Perm.​

​As Natasha grows to adulthood in the 1890’s in Odessa, she has a career as a​
​translator, linguist and writer. We know from the childhood scenes that she has an​
​eidetic memory and a knack for learning languages. During this time, she marries and​
​has 3 children. She is a political activist and works toward the revolution in 1905 and​
​1917 – perhaps she is a witness to the events surrounding the mutiny on the Battleship​
​Potemkin in Odessa in 1905 and the subsequent massacre on the steps.​
​Natasha resents how she was treated by her father Michael and Lillya’s father Yuri. She​
​holds a grudge against Lillya and her class for most of her life and this motivates her​
​political activism. She becomes a member of the communist party and perhaps a​
​powerful apparatchik but becomes estranged from the communists after the Holodomor​
​and Stalin’s purges. She is appalled when Stalin enters WW2 on the side of the Nazi’s​
​but when Germany invades Russia in 1941 she joins the fight against them. She works​
​for the Soviet government in WW2, perhaps with the Americans on the Lend Lease​
​arrangements. She reconciles with Lillya and helps her escape to America. She decides​
​to remain in Russia to carry on the fight.​
​Angelika Englehart – Lillya’s mother and Yuri’s wife who suffers from mental illness. She​
​had a youthful flirtation with Yuri’s cousin Michael that causes him to have a dalliance​
​with her maid (name TBD) who gives birth to Natasha. Angelika loves the baby so much​
​that she brings young Natasha into her home to be a kind of sister to Lillya – never​
​revealing that Natasha is Lillya’s cousin. She dies when Lillya is a young child.​
​Yuri Englehart - Lillya’s father whose overprotective nature causes problems for Lillya.​
​He indulges her and Natasha as children as well as his wife Angelika. He whisks Lillya​
​away from France when he learns of her interaction with Herve and destroys his letters​
​to her and does the same for any correspondence between Lillya and Natasha.​
​Anton Vronsky - Lillya’s wire-walking, circus leading husband and father of Vladimir. His​
​father is Dmitri, owner of the Vronsky family circus. His wife is the horsewoman Petra,​
​Vladimir’s mother.​​Yuri Englehart and Anton Vronsky​​will both die at the hands of the​
​Reds.​
​Michael Englehart - Yuri’s cousin falls in love with Yuri’s wife Angelika and in an attempt​
​to make her jealous he will have an affair with her maid (name TBD) who gives birth to​
​Natasha. His wife Greta does not bear him any children. He secretly spends time with​
​Natasha and her mother.  He will be betrayed to the Red Army in 1917 by Greta​
​because of her bitterness surrounding his love of Natasha and her children. He is killed​
​by the Reds.​
​Greta Englehart - Wife of Michael. She has a long simmering resentment of the cavalier​
​behavior of Yuri and Michael. Michael married her for money after Angelika rejected him​
​and she never bears him any children. She betrays Michael, Anton and Lillya to the​
​Reds at the encouragement of Helena.​

​Helena - Wife of Nikolai, the Kungur priest who first suggests to Greta that she can turn​
​Michael over the the reds and survive on the Englehart family jewels. Perhaps Helena​
​later betrays Greta to the Reds.​
​Herve Laurent Fleury – As a young cadet at the Cadre Noir he​​falls deeply in love with​
​Lillya. He asks her to marry him and gives her his most precious possession, an​
​emerald brooch that he inherited from his patron, an old French cavalry officer. He is​
​heartbroken when she leaves him and is deeply embittered by his experience with her.​
​He spends nearly his entire life filled with resentment – as is depicted in Circus of the​
​Queens. He comes to terms with it and redeems himself at the end of Circus but he is​
​quite surprised when Lillya comes to visit him in Charleston at the end of the second​
​book. They have a quiet reconciliation in the final scene.​
​Prisoners, Guards, and other additional characters with names like Julietta, Paul Blatsky​
​and Katrina and the group of women that Lillya joins in an abandoned shed are used as​
​needed. They are mentioned only once and can be expanded or deleted.​
​Story Outline​
​The book is composed of two alternating time lines in the life of Lillya one on the odd​
​numbered chapters and one on the even numbered chapters. The book has a short​
​prologue of Lillya riding like Pegasus flying, then 52 numbered chapters and an​
​epilogue – similar to the structure of Circus of the Queens.​
​The odd numbered timeline begins with the party at the palace in December 1916 and​
​ends with Lillya meeting Herve/Laurent again in November 1941. This timeline must be​
​augmented with information about Lillya being captured by the Red Army in 1917 and​
​what follows in her life in communist ruled Russia in the 1920’s and 1930’s. This period​
​will include Lillya surviving as a circus performer and riding teacher in Soviet Petrograd.​
​Eventually, Natasha will find her, reconcile and help her get to America in 1941 by,​
​perhaps arranging travel to the UK on a Lend Lease convoy returning from Arkangel.​
​She will fly to Gander, New Foundland with US pilots returning from delivering bombers​
​to England. She may meet a young Russian stowaway on the ship who she brings​
​along with her to Savannah. Finally, Lillya will have a scene in Charleston with​
​Herve/Laurent. This chapter will be #53 but named Epilogue.​
​The other timeline on the even numbered chapters begins with Lillya and Natasha​
​playing as very young children in about 1875. Lillya was born around 1868 and her​
​experience with Herve takes place around 1884. She marries Anton in 1885 and gives​
​birth to Vladimir in 1887. (These dates can be shifted a bit. The only fixed date in both​
​books is that in Circus of the Queens Donatalia is born around 1891. She dances at the​
​Winter Palace with Vladimir in 1904 (when he is 3 or 4 years older than she?). Lillya has​
​become a friend of Donatalia’s mother Katya a dancer married to Pele Petrovsky. One​
​day Katya is given the emerald brooch that Herve had slipped into Lillya’s pocket.​
​Perhaps Pele or Katya admired it. She does tell them that it was the gift of a special​
​friend (or something like that). Donatalia is given the brooch by her mother and she​
​3​

​admires it. Consequently, it gets packed into her suitcase by herself before she goes to​
​America in 1905. Herve/Laurent the man who gave Lillya that same brooch is​
​coincidentally on the same boat.​
​Lillya has a charmed life in the 1890’s and first years of the new century but after 1905​
​things begin to crumble. Vladimir and the Vronsky family circus are sent to America in​
​1905 but Lillya and Anton stay and share their life with the Czar’s family. They send​
​some of their family jewels to Vladimir in 1916 and these are only found years later in​
​Circus. More needs to be written to cover the years between 1905 and 1917 - especially​
​about the Bloody Sunday of 1905, the mutiny on the Battleship Potemkin and the killing​
​of peasants on the Odessa Steps. These events might be witnessed and written about​
​by a 35 year old Natasha. Lillya and Anton sent their son to America in 1905 and during​
​the next 12 years they read letters and newspaper clippings about the circus. They​
​learn about Vladimir’s four daughters and that he has renamed the circus as “The​
​Circus of the Queens” – they are joyful. We should expand on Lillya’s adult relationship​
​with Natasha and the story of Michael and Natasha’s mother. Perhaps, Lillya and​
​Natasha meet again after many years – neither realizing that Yuri destroyed the letters​
​sent between them as teenagers. Just as he had done with Laurent’s letters to Lillya.​
​They become estranged because Lillya doesn’t know that Michael is Natasha’s father​
​and that she and Natasha are cousins. Perhaps Lillya introduces Natasha as the​
​daughter of her childhood maid and Natasha is offended.​
​The childhood timeline on the even numbers ends in chapter 52 about where the other​
​timeline begins in chapter 1, perhaps just before the scene at the big party that opens​
​the book. This chapter will reveal why Lillya and Anton felt they had to make an​
​appearance at the party - perhaps they have realized that imperial Russia is coming to​
​an end. Perhaps that night Rasputin will be murdered and in the following days they are​
​barred from the company of the Royal family. The February revolution and the​
​abdication of the Czar must be covered in one timeline or the other and should be​
​positioned to have the best dramatic effect perhaps straddling both. This time period is​
​the pivotal moment in the collapse of the Romanov dynasty. Reference can be made to​
​the day in February 1917 when the Petrograd Garrison troops refuse to fire on the​
​protesters, shoot their own officers and join the revolution. The Czar abdicated four​
​days later bringing an end to 300 years of monarchy.​
​An additional note that can be applied to the story in several places:​
​All the Russian characters regard the United States as the obvious destination for an​
​escape from Russia. They have an idealized and affectionate view of the USA based​
​upon literature, movies and media. One or more of the characters in Lillya has an avid​
​interest in the history of the United States and its relationship with Russia. Perhaps the​
​young Vladimir studies maps of North America and observes that the Russian empire​
​once included Alaska and much of the northwest coast of America going as far south as​
​Fort Ross in Northern California. He laments the sale of Alaska to the USA in 1867. Just​
​think, Russia could have had a border with California!  Perhaps, Natasha reads the​
​works of Thomas Paine, Jefferson, Hamilton, Mark Twain and others and loves​
​American Wild West stories and movies like Charlie Chaplin’s City Lights. She notes​
​4​

​that the Russian Czarina, Catherine the Great helped the US in the Revolutionary War​
​and Czar Alexander II helped President Lincoln in the US Civil War. In turn, the US​
​provided Lend Lease support to the Russians fighting the Germans in WW1 as they will​
​also do in WW2.​
