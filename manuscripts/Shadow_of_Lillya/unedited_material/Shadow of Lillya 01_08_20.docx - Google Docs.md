​Lillya shut her eyes and squeezed them tight. She imagined every muscle and limb​
​of her father’s favorite black stallion, and like she did as a young girl, took off like​
​Pegasus flying. The faster the horse went, the clearer her past became, until it was​
​as real as the struggles of her days. The planets parted, the stars scattered, and a​
​trail of her memories were left in the shadow.​

​Chapter 1​
​St. Petersburg, Russia ~ 1916​
​The sparkle from the jewels sewn into the gowns, draped around necks, and held in​
​place by bezels on the tiaras of the courtly ladies’ heads was almost blinding. Giant​
​crystal chandeliers swayed to the beat of the music, while six-foot-tall marble​
​vases filled with leaves of palm the size of an African elephant’s ear stood guard,​
​eavesdropping on every conversation.​
​A drunken frenzy inspired the orchestra to play faster and faster. The loose limbs​
​of the dancers on the ballroom floor looked like trees in a hurricane swaying up​
​and down gyrating in circles then shaking like dogs just pulled out of a frozen​
​pond, they wiggled until they collapsed from exhaustion.​

​Lillya caught a glimpse of a mysterious man with deep penetrating eyes. He was​
​standing quietly in the corner of the room observing the aristocrats. Her eyes barely​
​met his but when they did for just a split second it was as if the firey tip of an​
​arrow quic kly entered and left her body. Lillya let out an unexpected “Aah” Loud​
​enough to draw Anton’s attention but soft enough to hide it from anyone else.​
​Lillya had heard stories of this man the healer who had caught the attention of the​
​Czar and Czarina and she didn’t want anything to do with him.​
​A count poured a pitcher of drink down the front of a duchess’ finely stitched dress​
​and then without any sort of inhibition he started to lick it. Soon he was under her​
​dress. The duchess unfolded her fan as though she were blushing in mock​
​embarrassment. The count popped his head out, quite content with himself, and​
​addressed the crowd, not noticing the man in the corner. “Do you know what secret​
​I found under there?”​
​The guests shouted back, “No!”​
​The count smiled, then winked and said, “The Empress doesn’t go to the hospital​
​to help the soldiers. She goes because the czar no longer satisfies her. She’s taken​
​on a lover. I hear it’s a healer, but who? Who could it be?” He said again as if to​
​challenge the crowd. Then he grabbed the drunk duchess’ hand and started dancing​
​once again, knowing he had left one word on the lips of all in attendance, “Who?”​
​Lillya watched as the mysterious man in the corner, left the room.​

​***​
​“We don’t have to stay, my dear,” Anton whispered in Lillya’s ear. “We’ve shown​
​ourselves. We can go now.”​
​Curious as to the goings-on at court Lillya later discovered that this man yielded​
​more power then she had imagined. He would influence the future of her dear​
​Russia and be at the heart of many rumors.​
​Lillya Xenia Englehardt Vronsky was not quite as anxious as her husband to​
​depart. “Dance with me,” she said unexpectedly. “You know everyone loves to​
​watch you. You are the best dancer in this ballroom,” Lillya told her husband.​
​“Besides we need to stay informed, now more than ever,” she smiled through her​
​teeth. She knew he knew she was right, but she was also aware he had no stomach​
​for such affairs. It pained him to watch men and women he had once respected​
​throw away their dignity so easily as if it were an old scrap of food and simple to​
​replace. However, Lillya knew Anton Vronsky would not refuse her.​
​Russia and St. Petersburg were fighting for their lives. “Millions of soldiers have​
​died,” Lillya thought to herself. “And all the upper class can think about is​
​overindulgence, intrigue and lies.”​
​As if he were able to read her thoughts, Anton whispered, “When they count their​
​money and jewels tomorrow, I hope they tuck some of it away. One of these days​
​the tables could turn and where will they all be then?” Anton did not say this to​

​5​
​scare her. He simply wanted her to have a more realistic idea of how the people​
​outside of their class felt. What was their level of aggravation and frustration and​
​underneath that, anger? He had a unique perspective, that of a common man who​
​had been brought into the folds of high society. With one eye he read the aristocrats​
​and with his other eye the people who came to his circus and the vendors from​
​whom he bought food and trinkets most every day on the street.​
​Born to be the heir of the most famous Russian family circus and having come​
​from a long line of high-wire walkers like his father, Dimitri Vronsky who owned​
​the circus that was located near the Bolshoi. Every day of his life from boyhood to​
​the day he turned the circus over to his own son, Vladimir, Anton mixed and​
​worked with the people who filled his family’s bleachers. His circus made the​
​crowds laugh and scream. Yes, Anton felt certain he had a broader view of the​
​temperature of the world and such matters. He had married into the upper class but​
​could still see the world through the eyes of the people. With that in mind years​
​earlier, before the 1905 revolution and before he turned gray, Anton and Lillya​
​passed on their legacy, the Vronsky Family Circus, to their son who now lived in​
​America with his wife and four daughters. For this, Anton was glad, for he knew​
​they were safe. NowAnton only had to focus on his wife, and that was enough.​
​The palace, Lillya noted, had recently adopted a frugal existence. Still, the message​
​they were trying to send seemed to have little to no effect on the upper class, nor​

​6​
​did it dictate their actions. The aristocrats, simply put, did not want to see, feel, or​
​accept the rage and growing anger of the people just outside the palace doors or in​
​the streets where they shopped, or in front of their homes. Even though they could​
​see a dark cloud was rising above them, they continued to spend enormous sums of​
​money frivolously while the population was feeling the pangs of war and hunger​
​and this opulent ball was just one example.​
​As times got worse, Lillya and Anton moved onto her family’s estate. They now​
​lived with Lillya’s father, Yuri Engelhart. It seemed to be the right thing to do and a​
​natural fit. He loved good alcohol, fine fabrics pasatoral paintings, exotic food and​
​most of all fine horses. He valued athleticism and people who did the best that they​
​could at whatever it was that sparked their passion. He enjoyed watching his​
​grandson Vladimir when he was a child, learning all the feats he would need to​
​know to lead and run the family’s circus that would be his destiny and made Yuri​
​wonder what they really thought about his estate and all that had come with it by​
​birth. But Yuri enjoyed the world that his daughter had become a part of, and on​
​afternoons when he had nothing else to do, he would visit the Vronsky Family​
​Circus, sit in the bleachers, and watch the dancing bears and elephants and tigers​
​all learn new tricks, and he was fascinated. “It takes so much more skill,” he said to​
​his daughter Lillya, “It would take me a lifetime of learning patience to do what​
​they do. I so admire the talents your son is inheriting.”​

​7​
​In later years, long after Lillya and Anton stitched a life together, to the extent that​
​Yuri had enjoyed Anton’s circus, equally, Anton surprised himself by the way he so​
​easily adjusted to a life of leisure living with Yuri.​
​<Date or reference to the revolution needed to place this is historical time. This​
​sounds like it follows the 1917 revoluton.>​
​Still, sometimes of late, Lillya had to admit that it felt as if the world around her​
​was crumbling especially in regard to Russia, her home country, the country she​
​loved with all her heart.​
​Russia was battling with itself both inside and out and it wasn’t long before news​
​began to trickle in about; arrests of friends, other wealthy aristocrats, some, who​
​just like Lillya and Anton, had attended the ball not even three months past. The​
​uncertainty of their future began to haunt her and she found herself staying up late​
​into the night trying to wash the nightmares away. She remembered each one and​
​could repeat them all at will with incredible detail and skill similar to the​
​concentration it took her when creating her own fine needlework. Fear ran up and​
​down her body again and just as it had the night before, and she witnessed herself​
​tripping over a small log and landing in the middle of a big mud puddle. She​
​couldn’t get up by herself. The mud was like glue and she couldn’t escape. She was​
​vulnerable and unable to protect herself. “Which army would eventually come to​
​get them?” she wondered. She found it almost impossible to come up for air and​

​8​
​she thought she would die. Then a man with a familiar demeanor came down from​
​heaven to visit her and he wrapped his arms around her and told her not to worry​
​because he would save her. Day to day night by night it seemed as if she tried out​
​different dreams to see how they would fit just as someone else might try on an​
​overcoat. She would feel it and smell it and use different voices to better​
​understand it. Would it be the Reds or Whites that would ultimately come and take​
​them away? She tried to keep her immense fear to herself and would remind​
​herself that fear only breeds more fear. News continued to find its way to their​
​door, and none of it was good.​
​Protests and scuffles between the political factions became more violent. Every​
​couple of days it seemed someone they knew vanished, and soon Lillya and Anton​
​were forced to face the truth. “St. Petersburg has gotten too dangerous for people​
​like us,” Anton finally told his wife. “We can’t hold off any longer.”​
​Lillya was in agreement with her husband. She felt bad, for Anton was only guilty​
​by association, and as her husband, love bound him to protect her.  Many of Lillya​
​and Anton’s friends were being forced to clean toilets, while some had simply​
​disappeared. Had they been captured, or had they escaped?​
​Lillya’s family was not a so high up rhe the aristocratic laddder, but they were all​
​well-liked and they each had a special talent that could not be replicated. Her​
​father’s gift was to be good at most everything he tried, but most of all he was kind​

​9​
​and he was charming. Still, Lillya realized that had she not been married to Anton​
​she might have already fallen into one of those categories and none were very​
​appealing. “You’re right,” she said to Anton and her father over dinner. “I​
​understand, it’s time for us to go.”​
​The weeks before their departure, her father and Anton planned and plotted. “It’s​
​good that you could see so far ahead, Yuri,” Anton said after Yuri reviewed his idea​
​of sending Lillya and Anton off to their cousin Michael and the favors Michael​
​owed him.  “He’s a good man, but one needs a little more than goodness during​
​these times to get someone to risk their life.” So, it was decided and Lillya had her​
​own reasons to follow suit.  Besides her father, Anton loved her more than anyone​
​and both would give their own lives to save her, so she had no reason not to trust​
​their plan.​
​Until that day, though, Lillya decided to appreciate every minute and every​
​pleasure that she had been afforded during her life; besides, riding her favorite​
​stallion to try to take her mind off of what was about to happen seemed like a smart​
​thing to her.​
​“Am I grayer than I was last week?” she asked her husband. They all seemed to​
​grow older in that short period of time, more than she had imagined possible. As​
​they came up with the details of their plan, it became clear her father would stay​
​behind.​

​10​
​***​
​“I insist! Our old workhorse, Sophie, is exactly the kind of horse I will need, and​
​she won’t attract attention. Sophie and Timur are my choices and Anton can choose​
​a horse to pull our cart.  That’s enough.  Any more and we’ll have thieves outside​
​our campfire waiting for the fire to grow dim so they can jump in and take what is​
​ours.”​
​The day of their parting came like any other. The sun rose, they ate their breakfast​
​together, and joked as if they would be doing the same tomorrow. But as the hour​
​of their departure neared, their emotions began to take over.​
​Lillya heard her father searching through his favorite room. “Not this one.” And he​
​broke the bottle. She knew better than to join him at this moment. He had a right to​
​release his feelings in private. Lillya reflected on the many hours her father had​
​spent throughout the years categorizing, arranging and rearranging this room. She​
​wondered if her old father would be walking as well as he did for a man his age if​
​he had not had the determination each day to to walk up and down the stairs to his​
​cellar to dote on the many bottles that made him so happy.​
​Minutes later she heard her father express a very satisfied, “Yes.” She quickly​
​moved away from the door. She didn’t want her father to think she had been​
​listening.​

​11​
​“We’re going to have a little something before I send you off,” he said when he​
​climbed back up the stairs. “Can’t let you go without warming you up a bit first.​
​Tell that husband of yours to come inside.”​
​When Lillya and Anton entered her father’s study, he was opening an ungodly​
​expensive bottle of Massandra Sherry that had once been a part of the Czar’s​
​private wine collection. Uncorking it like the expert he was, he poured three​
​glasses. He refused to make a toast, for there would be no solemn goodbye, instead​
​he lit his pipe and sat back in his old leather chair to better enjoy the smell of his​
​tobacco. Lillya had enjoyed watching her father perform this ritual since she was a​
​llttle girl. Next would come a soft, high, gurgly sound, the sound of her father​
​imploring his tongue to fall into place and his lungs to pull in just the right amount​
​of air to kidnap the scent of the wine’s bouquet.​
​Without saying a word, they were all aware of the placement of the sun. They had​
​decided they would depart before sunset, the time of least recognition.​
​Anton went back outside to check on the horses. He also wanted Lillya to have a​
​few moments alone with her father. They all knew that this was very likely the last​
​time they would see one another in this physical lifetime.​
​Lillya had passed on the stallion and her favorite mare. She told her solid​
​workhorses that they would soon be the ones leading the way Lillya heard her​
​father and Anton approaching from the front door. She knew it was the front door​

​12​
​because of the peculiar sound the front door made. It reminded her of the racket of​
​the cricket chorus in the field nearby.​
​Over the many years she had lived in this home she had come to recognize the​
​creaks and squeaks and sound of every wood plank in each room of the house and​
​the distinctive way each door sang  to her when it opened and closed. It was as if​
​they had created and learned anew their own language. “It makes the house​
​friendlier,” she told her father when she was only a young woman.  Some nights​
​she joked with her father telling him that the she had begun to understand what​
​they said.​
​About to say something she held her breath. She felt a strange sense of foreboding.​
​But why wouldn’t she? She was leaving the place that held so many memories​
​from her childhood until now. They knew their reality their entire way of life was​
​going to vanish. It seemed unfathomable. In a way, they felt detached even though​
​they found themselves right in the center and all that was happening. In their minds​
​they were simply players on the stage of life.​
​Lilly leaned in to give her father one last kiss but he touched her shoulder to stop​
​her.​
​“I have something to give you, Lillya.” Her father said. “I should have done this​
​years ago, but I didn’t have the courage. It’s wrapped in a small, ordinary maid’s​
​towel so if a thief sees it they’ll think it holds no value. Inside are answers to the​

​13​
​many questions I know still linger. Put it someplace safe and if you can, keep it to​
​yourself.”​
​Lillya lifted one corner of the package to see what was inside. It was her father’s​
​journal. “Some of the pages are soiled, but it’s all that you’ll need” he told Lillya.​
​“Now go. Finish getting yourself ready. You are not a young girl anymore, and​
​don’t worry about your old papa. I’ve had a good life and more than any other​
​person, it was you who brought me joy, and that son of yours. Oh, how I miss​
​him.”​
​Anton walked back in the house and her father kissed Anton on the cheek and​
​grasped both his hands.​
​“Take care of my daughter as you always have,” he said to Anton.  “Remember,​
​you are to head toward the Ural Mountain range then go to the town of Kungur. It​
​is near Perm.”​
​“Perm. That’s where Natasha is from,” Lillya reflected silently.​
​Her father continued. “You will go to​​the lower part​​of the town. On Kittarskaya​
​Street is the Uspenskaya Church. Your mother’s cousin Michael is friends with the​
​priest,” he said. Then he glanced at Lillya the same way he had when she was a​
​child to make certain she was listening. “He is expecting you. The priest and his​
​church have received large donations for this service,” he went on to say. “The​
​church has places where you both will be able to hide together, safely in plain​

​14​
​sight.” Yuri slowed his speech wanting to drag out each word, not wanting this​
​conversation to end. “Michael has many trustworthy friends. Besides, in doing this​
​he is paying back an old debt.”​
​“Thank you, Papa. I promise we won’t forget. I love you!”​
​Staying behind was surely a death sentence, but he had decided there was not a​
​better nor more fitting place for him to die. He had never needed such a big house​
​nor so much property. It had been passed down to him as all property got passed​
​down to the firstborn male. It was all he had ever known. And now he had a​
​lifetime of memories and was too old and formed in his habits to start anew. He​
​loved his estate, the wine and the horses and he had always taken good care of the​
​families who lived with them. There would be no goodbyes. Instead two short​
​French phrases rolled off his tongue. “​À​​prochaine​​fois​” and “​Je t'embrasse très​
​fort​.” Then he did his best to smile. However, that​​was the day everything changed.​
​Lillya could feel her father’s eyes on her back, but she did not dare turn around  for​
​fear that all the courage she had gathered up to have the strength to go would​
​evaporate into dust and she would run back to him, wrap her arms around his neck​
​and never let go.​
​How would all of this conflict end? Where would this revolution of the soul go and​
​where would it take the people and the country she loved? How would they ever be​
​able to fix all that they had blindly broken? Was there any goodness left floating in​

​15​
​the sky tucked underneath a big fluffy cloud? Or a place on earth where peace and​
​truth reigned? Had kindness disappeared? What would happen to her father and​
​Anton and her son Vladimir? What would be left for the children and where would​
​they go? The Russia she knew had been fading away, breaking up bit by bit,​
​disappearing before their eyes and in its place all that was left was confusion and​
​poverty, laced with violence and fear. Sadly, what she had hoped would only last​
​weeks, turned into months and years.​

​Childhood Days- Before the storm ~1860​
​Chapter 2​
​“It’s mine,” Natasha said, and she grabbed the necklace right out of Lillya’s hand.​
​“You know that’s not true.  It was a gift from the Duchess herself. That’s what my​
​grandmother told me.” However, Lillya’s grandmother was really a great aunt who​
​thought her dead younger sister’s daughter would need one and it was a role she​
​had been training for and one she thught she could fulfill.”​
​Lillya didn’t see her grandmother often; she lived in Moscow and traveled to other​
​parts of Europe frequently with her husband from whom she inherited her title and​
​royalty. Nonetheless Lillya was sentimental about the old woman, more so than​
​most others in her life.​
​“It’s only because your mother died and me and the old one are your only true​
​friends.” For a second Natasha felt bad for saying something so hurtful, but Lillya​

​17​
​took Natasha’s guilt and used it against her and in this moment of weakness she​
​tackled Natasha and pinned her down on the floor. After a few minutes they both​
​got tired and Natasha gave up.​
​“Okay, here it is.” Laughing she handed Lillya the simple heart-shaped ruby​
​necklace. Remembering her place, she lifted Lillya’s long golden wavy hair and​
​spun it into a bun on the top of Lillya’s head, then added a deep red rose from the​
​garden that was conveniently in a vase nearby. She put the flower in Lillya’s hair to​
​top off her masterpiece. Then she clasped the lock closed and let the necklace fall​
​down Lillya’s front where it rested just above her chest.​
​“Now turn around so I can see how it shines almost as brightly as your eyes. But​
​it’s not nearly as beautiful as you,” said Natasha. Lillya just smiled. She was used​
​to these sorts of easy compliments from Natasha.​
​Another maid walked through the door. “Will you please prepare a bath for​
​Lillya?” Natasha asked. Then she watched and waited until the bathwater was​
​poured, the maid knowing that Natasha had almost full authority to ask for​
​whatever she liked when it came to Lillya. The maid delicately removed Lillya’s​
​clothes and helped her slip into the tub.​
​Lillya admired Natasha’s composure and self-assuredness. She never brought up​
​money or that by social class she was far above Natasha’s station, for she liked and​
​respected her too much to do something so cruel. They had grown up together.​

​18​
​Natasha was more like a sister than anything else. Lillya couldn’t remember a time​
​when she didn’t know Natasha. As far as she was concerned, they had shared most​
​everything since birth.  Still, as they grew older, their difference in stature and how​
​society would judge them would become more apparent, for Natasha would remain​
​forever the server and Lillya the receiver.​
​Sometimes Natasha, as much as she loved Lillya, couldn’t stop herself from getting​
​a bit fed up with her situation, and she would find herself becoming a bit​
​manipulative.  Natasha would search for a way to turn the tables and on more than​
​one occasion, she almost had Lillya convinced that by being poor, Natasha was the​
​wealthy one. Like the beautiful summer day when Lillya’s father Yuri took Natasha​
​shopping, even though Natasha knew most everything that they would buy together​
​would ultimately end up on Lillya, Natasha knew that Lillya would see it as a way​
​for one of them to spend more time with her father, garnering his attention. Being​
​the same size as Lillya worked for and against each of them depending upon their​
​mood and generosity of spirit. Recognizing their similarities, when Yuri wanted to​
​buy something special for Lillya and he wanted to pick it out himself, Lillya’s​
​father would often arrange for Natasha to have the day off. This way he wouldn’t​
​have to interrupt Lillya’s studies and Natasha got to spend an entire day by herself​
​with Lillya’s father. And if he bought Lillya a new blouse, he purchased a​
​smart-looking scarf for Natasha along with a lovely belt so they each got to show​

​19​
​off something special. But for Natasha, the best gift she received on her days spent​
​with Yuri was the silent permission he gave her to converse freely, show off her​
​intelligence, wit and humor, and every smile that Yuri gave her in return was more​
​than enough reward for her. If she had been rich, she would have been stuck at​
​home like Lillya with the tutor, memorizing her lessons instead of spending the day​
​with the best seamstress in all of St. Petersburg.​
​Natasha was beautiful like Lillya, and they shared a similar slant of the nose and a​
​distinct dimple on their chins. Both girls could not believe their luck to be so​
​similar in both spirit and looks. They were close in age and often pretended they​
​were twins. Natasha was skilled like Lillya, but in different ways. She had a​
​photographic memory and could remember everything Lillya had ever read to her,​
​every classic, every poem. She could recite what she had heard almost word for​
​word. She excelled in history and even learned to speak French just by sitting next​
​to Lillya during her lessons. French, the language of the aristocracy, slipped off her​
​tongue easier than it did her patron.​
​Natasha’s mother was a housekeeper at a nearby estate and they moved to St.​
​Petersburg from Perm when she was barely three. Her father, well they never spoke​
​of him and Natasha had come to the conclusion that she was better off that way. It​
​allowed her to design the father she wanted. Only she needed to believe it was true,​

​20​
​and she could keep him ito herself and continue living her life, and nobody​
​bothered her or disagreed.​
​Natasha visited her mother every Sunday. A woman would come from the estate​
​where her mother worked and would dress her in the clothes Yuri’s personal maid​
​had laid out for her, but when she arrived where her mother worked no matter how​
​beautifully or elegantly she had been dressed she would be sent to the back door​
​where where her mother and the other help entered and her mother would greet her​
​with a big smile. She had been instructed many years prior to never enter through​
​the house from the main entrance.​
​Natasha loved her mother, but over time Sunday became her least favorite day of​
​the week. But still it gave her the one thing she knew LIllya wanted and yearned​
​for but did not have, a mother.​
​Natasha worshipped Lillya and taking care of Lillya and being her friend became​
​Natasha’s “raison d’​ê​tre.” And her rewards came with​​pretty clothes, good books​
​and education, very unusual for anyone of her class. Most of the time she felt​
​privileged to have been given such an important job. It made her feel a step above​
​the other maids, and she was.​
​Lillya’s father Yuri was a tall handsome man who stood out from across a room.​
​However, what made him special to Natasha was his ability to see what was special​
​about her, and the way he quietly encouraged her by allowing Natasha to sit in on​

​21​
​Lillya’s tutoring sessions and make certain she was not disturbed. Lillya could​
​have objected, but she enjoyed the company and later she had someone to discuss​
​that day’s lesson with who could remember it almost word for word.​
​***​
​Lillya stood up in the tub. The maid was waiting with a towel to dry Lillya off and​
​prepare her for evening’s supper. She undid her bun and took out the lily Natasha​
​had put in her hair and she shook her big mane. It was almost as thick as a horse’s​
​tail. Drops of water splattered across the room, leaving pools of water on the floor.​
​Petra and Dimitri Vronsky from the famous Vronsky Family Circus were coming​
​to their home to show her father a young mare they thought would be good for​
​breeding. “They’ll be staying for supper,” her father announced earlier.​
​Lillya had never been to the circus and she was curious. She had been brought up​
​to believe that you only went to the circus if you had been invited to watch the​
​performers at the palace of the Czar. It was below them, but recently her father had​
​changed his mind. As he got to know Dimitri better, he found himself growing​
​fonder of the man who was a master on the tightrope and a wizard when it came to​
​horses. Dimitri was well educated and very clever, besides being strong and brave.​
​All qualities Yuri admired, he enjoyed Dimitri’s dry wit and sense of humor. “The​
​man says what he thinks and doesn’t stop himself from expressing what he really​

​22​
​feels. Most men are afraid of what other men might think, but this makes him​
​courageous in my eyes.”​
​Lillya started talking excitedly while the maid was drying her off. “Papa says when​
​Mr. Vronsky touches a horse something magical happens. He knows which ones to​
​choose. It’s as if they speak to him,” she told Natasha.​
​Natasha was fumbling through Lillya’s drawers.​
​“What are you looking for?” she asked.​
​“Got it!” and Natasha pulled out a simple gold necklace to complement Lillya’s​
​ruby, along with a matching bracelet.​
​“Now that’s perfect,” she said, feeling quite satisfied with herself. “They’ll be here​
​within the hour, we must hurry.”​
​A blue-green gown with gold threads was waiting on Lillya’s bed, but first they​
​had to fix her hair. “If you move any slower, they’ll find someone to replace me​
​and then what would you do?” Natasha teasingly barked.​
​“Papa would never replace you. I couldn’t live without your company,” Lillya​
​replied. “I’d have to go on a hunger strike.”​
​Natasha smiled because she knew Lillya was telling the truth.​
​Looking out the window Lillya saw the Vronskys coming up to the house from the​
​stables. “Papa’s got a smile on his face. He must have liked what he saw. Looks​
​like he decided she’s the one.”​

​23​
​Lillya quickly walked down the stairs into the Parlor where the Vronskys and her​
​father had just been poured drinks and the help was serving caviar. Her father​
​seemed to be quite taken in by the couple.  Her father rarely grinned and only​
​showed his poker face to strangers, but on this occasion, he could barely fit all the​
​happiness he felt inside of himself.​
​Petra’s petite figure was dressed in a bold royal blue and her dark shiny hair​
​blended with streaks of amber, yellow and gold was pulled back and wrapped into​
​a perfect twist. Her smile was bright and warm and would disarm any soldier she​
​came in contact wit. Yes, any man determined to do battle with her, would surely​
​lose and fall to her feet.​
​Petra had a relaxed natural way about her and she did not notice her effect on men.​
​She would casually throw her head back to get her hair out of her eyes and laugh as​
​if she were the only one in the room. She clearly loved her life and her husband​
​most of all.​
​***​
​“Our daughter Lillya is the horsewoman of our family and she is going to love​
​your horse!​
​“ Lillya, this is Mr. and Mrs. Vronsky from the famed Vronsky Family Circus,”​
​Yuri said.​
​“Your father has told us much about you,” Mr. Vronsky nterjected.​

​24​
​Lillya for a moment wbecame speechless as her father continued to brag about her​
​with a great sense of pride.”He says you can an already ride standing up. That’s a​
​great accomplishment andt says much about your character.”​
​“I find if one is balanced and is not afraid and speaks kindly to a horse she knows​
​quite well, that most anything is possible,” Lillya shylyreplied. “That is with​
​practice, of course.”​
​“I must agree,” Petra Vronsky replied. “I have seen tricks on horses that would​
​stump a magician.” Lillya instantly liked her. She found it easy to talk with Petra​
​and imagined they had much n common and would have been friends in another​
​lifetime.​
​A butler called them in for supper. Lillya caught a glimpse of Natasha at the top of​
​the stairs and was happy she was listening in. She wished that she could call​
​Natasha down to join them, but they both knew their place. She would have to​
​share the evening with her later.​
​Biting into a Cornish hen, she admired their cook’s ability to add just the right​
​amount of paprika on top of it and dole out to each person a perfect serving size of​
​rosemary potatoes. Lillya soon forgot about Natasha, savoring each bite and morsel​
​of food, especially the conversation.​
​She let her father take the lead, remembering they had company, for it might have​
​sounded rude for her to ask the questions she wanted to know the answers to​

​25​
​immediately. Finally, they got around to the subject Lillya was most interested in​
​hearing about, the circus. She was besotted by a story Dimitri told about their tigers​
​Midnight and Satin.  They were recently given to the Vronskys from a Prince from​
​India after he saw their circus perform for the Czar and his children on the lawn of​
​the Winter Palace. Dimitri said, “I was rehearsing one afternoon when all of a​
​sudden I heard a tremendous amount of commotion. I stopped to see what was​
​going on. When I went out front there were five royal carriages. The one in the​
​middle had the names Midnight and Satin painted on both sides in beautiful​
​colorful calligraphy. I stood there dumbfounded.​
​By now Petra was outside next to me.”​
​“Yes,” Petra agreed.​
​“Holding Petra’s hand, Dimitri continued,” I inched in close to the carriage. A man​
​in formal Indian dress handed me a letter and said, “This is a gift from the prince.​
​You must have made quite an impression!”​
​“Inside the gilded cage were two tiger kittens, playing with a big ball of yarn. The​
​representative continued to say that they had been abandoned on the prince’s estate​
​and that the prince himself had personally nursed them back to health. So, what​
​was I to do,” Dimitri asked, “but to humbly accept them?”​
​“I used to go inside their cage and play with them until they got too big,” Petra​
​said. Lillya’s ears perked up even more when Petra mentioned they had a son who​

​26​
​walked the high wire and was also a notable horseman. She got chills just thinking​
​of anyone walking across a wire fifty feet up in the air, for only Natasha knew that​
​Lillya became afraid of heights if there was not something solid between her and​
​the ground. A horse was solid, so she had no problem standing up on the back of a​
​galloping roisenback. “Anyone can do that, but to walk a wire, why that is​
​magnificent.” Petra could see Lillya was mesmerized by the glint she saw in her​
​eyes that became similar to the glint in her own eyes when she first saw Dimitri​
​perform his act. Both Lillya and Yuri could not hide their fascination.​
​Later that night Lillya shared the events of the evening with Natasha, and did not​
​fail to say “Oh, and did I tell you, his mother mentioned they have a son who walks​
​the high wire?”​
​“I wonder why they made no offer of an introduction. They didn’t even tell me his​
​name. They simply said he was talented and had a playful sort of personality.  They​
​should know that I’m old enough to meet their son.” Lillya went on. “Thank​
​goodness for Papa though. By the end of the evening he decided to put his stallion​
​with their mare. Then he promised the Vronskys that we would attend their circus​
​sometime soon.”​
​“After all, our horses are going to bring our families together,” Lillya’s father said​
​to the Vronskys as they were leaving.​
​Lillya’s father had no idea how true his words would become.​

​27​
​New Chapter <After the 1917 Revolution>​
​Keeping a secret is much harder to do when your audience is already mistrusting.​
​No one seemed to tell the truth. The trick was to be able to sense true from the​
​false and learn to interpret a constantly ever-changing code. The White Army was​
​made up mostly of Russia’s armed forces, members of the upper classes, and​
​soldiers from other nations. They didn’t like one another, and they certainly​
​weren’t unified. At least that is what Anton told Lillya. Then the Reds had Trotsky,​
​Lenin, and Stalin, who were in competition for ultimate rule and would trip one​
​another up any chance they got, of course for the good of the cause. But then again​

​28​
​Lillya thought, “Even my father was not completely truthful until he handed me his​
​journal. Or one could say he told the truth with great omissions.” This​
​leather-bound book would speak more intimately to Lillya in her father’s voice,​
​more then he had his whole life. The flames drew her into herself and got her​
​thinking of the large townhouse where she and Anton had lived when Vladimir​
​was still young. She reminessed about its gigantic fireplace and she wondered if​
​those striking flames from so many years prior were trying to tell her something​
​and she hadn’t been listening. Then a spark from the fire made a loud crackling​
​sound and shook her back to the present. In the distance, she could hear horses​
​galloping and she wondered if they were white or red, or perhaps Czechs? They​
​were fighting a world war on the Russian front, but soon their army found​
​themselves intertwined in a civil war as well.​
​Her ears followed the sound of the riders while her mind ran in circles until​
​eventually she landed where she began. “Maybe they are just like us; people on the​
​run and hiding?” Still, she held her breath until they passed.​
​The cruelty of both sides had become well known. Lillya knew that their lives​
​could easily fall into the whimsy of a handful of soldiers. And their fate would be​
​decided by what kind of night or day these soldiers had had. If the soldiers had had​
​a good day they might only take your food and horses. On a bad day, they would​
​also shoot you and not think twice.​

​29​
​Lillya thought about the journal her father had given to her. She was anxious to​
​read it. She was having a hard time falling asleep. The abandoned cabin they were​
​in was cold and dark. Still, she and Anton were grateful for the cover from the​
​wind. Lillya watched Anton’s stomach rising up and down and every once in a​
​while, he would make a funny little squeaking sound through his nostrils. Trying​
​not to make any noise while making sure he was asleep, she put his handkerchief​
​lightly over his nose to lessen the sound and quietly slipped her thumb and her​
​index finger into the bag that carried her belongings, including now her father’s​
​journal, wanting to be able to read even just a little corner of truth before she said​
​her  nightly prayers,and goodnight to, parents,.husband, her loved ones in America​
​and then she would set her mind and point it to  a happy place so that when she​
​awoke the following day she could start it without any discoloration from the day​
​before .​
​”Just a few words and I’ll put you right back,” she toyed with herself and the​
​journal as if she were making a bargain with God. Anton’s snoring became much​
​louder and deeper even though he was a light sleeper. She didn’t want to risk​
​waking him, nor did she want him to catch her reading a journal he knew nothing​
​about. Her father had asked her to keep it to herself and that’s what she intended to​
​do to the best of her ability. But Lillya soon came to realize that when one finds​

​30​
​themselves in the middle of a revolution with no end in sight, they should avoid​
​making promises for they are not easy to keep.​
​LiIllya could see Anton’s legs becoming restless and soon he would open his eyes.​
​Lillya got shivers up and down her spine. But she wasn’t certain if this chill was​
​because she felt embarassment and guilt that she would be discovered reading a​
​book of secrets that for the time-being her father had asked remain between just the​
​two of them or had she simply gotten a chill from sleeping in a drafty old cottage.​
​Either way for now she would hold her father’s secrets to herself. She wrapped his​
​journal quickly back into the maid’s towel and threw it in her satchel.​
​Anton rubbed his hands over his eyes. Then he shook his right leg several times​
​and next his left, made a sudden jerky motion as if he had not been sleeping at all​
​and then sat up.​
​“What are you doing my dear?” He said in a clear authoritative voice, “Tomorrow​
​is a big day. You’re going to need your sleep.” Noticing Lillya was shivering, he​
​came over with a  blanket and gently layed it on top of her making sure he had​
​covered her feet then he bent down and gave her a kiss to remind her he was​
​watching over her.​

​31​
​“Thank you my sweet,” she replied and closed her eyes. “The journal will be there​
​in the morning,” she whispered to herself. Then nodding to Anton, she said.​
​“Perhaps if I keep my eyes closed and think sweet thoughts I will sleep.” But​
​before she knew it, small rays of sunlight were finding their way into the cabin and​
​they were planning their day.​
​The horses she had heard earlier were now off in the distance frightening someone​
​else. Lillya took a deep breath and let out a sigh of relief. Her husband had done​
​what he could the evening before to keep her warm and protect her from the​
​unknown danger lurking in the woods.​
​Anton handed her a large cup of tea to help her greet the morning and when he was​
​through, he covered the fire with a large pot to suffocate and put out the flame.​
​“If we hurry, my dear, I believe we can reach Kungur before sunset.” But by the​
​look on her face she let him know he was going to have have to be more enticing​
​and seductive than that to get her to give up her blanket for the cold and unknown.​
​“I can almost smell the faint taste of leather off in the distance.” Lillya could smell​
​what her husband was talking about but decided it could only smell that delicious​
​to someone who was making money from it. He added, as if he were describing a​
​freshly frosted cake, “That is what has made made Kungar so famous. It’s on the​
​tip of my nose. Can you smell it?”, he asked Lillya. Trying to engage her senses.​
​Anton repeated his words once more, hoping this time like a happy fisherman he​

​32​
​would see his catch at the end of his rod when he lifted it out of the water. “Maybe​
​Kungar will satisfy my craving.”​
​“Yes,” Lillya responded, “Kungur.” Then she paused for several seconds, put on a​
​grin that almost matched his, “Isn’t that the last stop before nowhere?”  Lillya and​
​Anton both burst out in laughter.​
​“I guess it’s not so bad. At least we’ll be on the west side of the mountain range.​
​Think of our Czar and his family; they’re on the Eastern side in Siberia with five​
​million square miles of nothing but isolation, ice and snow,” Anton went on now​
​that he knew he had her attention.​
​“We should be grateful. We’ll be near Perm where there is a decent Opera, and I​
​hear they grow watermelon in the summer,” Lillya said in a voice that could almost​
​pass as joyful while under her breath she was pondering the thought, “Could​
​Natasha be there?”​
​“Perm Provence is large,” Anton continued. “Remember we will be at the mercy of​
​others. This is not a vacation, Lillya.”​
​Lillya had never been to Siberia, still all Russians had heard stories of the place​
​and found ways to romanticize the rough life it took to survive with its many​
​unique qualities, but most shuddered with fear at the thought of being forced to live​
​there. Some compared it to a batch of stew where a little of everything was thrown​
​in until it became something new. European prisoners of war mixed with native​

​33​
​Aboriginal tribesmen and they sometimes spiced the pot by throwing in a Russian​
​Jew or political exile. Then there was the Trans-Siberian Railway; workers from​
​around the world populated that path for over 15 years while they built it.​
​For a few minutes Lillya had given herself permission to daydream.  Every once in​
​a while, as Anton spoke, she caught a glimpse of her old self. The teenage girl who​
​galloped through the woods like a streak of lightning while standing upright on the​
​back of her father’s favorite stallion.​
​***(The following segment comes later, mention of carriage house and Gretta.)​
​***​
​Afraid to pull the journal completely out of her bag, Lillya squinted, trying to​
​follow a  soft ray of moon light that entered the carriage house  through the cracks​
​from rhe small scratched back window door with the green and brown stitched​
​curtain Gretta had made in the bright shining day light.​
​Lillya wondered where it would one day all lead. She found herself and Anton​
​getting more and more entangled in this mess and she became that much more​
​determined that she would find a way out. “I will see my son and his wife and​
​children before I leave this earth behind. I will see the equestrian Ann Marie Heart​
​and maybe her children, too. I will have grand conversations with our scholar,​

​34​
​Lucky, watch Spade carry on the family tradition and walk the high wire, and​
​Diamond will sparkle, I’m sure just as she does in the photographs Vladimir and​
​Belle had sent me. She must be a star in her own right by now. Yes, Lillya became​
​determined that she would see her grandaughters and get to know Bella, Vladimir’s​
​wife. Each night Lillya would prop herself up after Anton fell asleep once she had​
​discovered the spot that gave her the best light. Then she would read in secrecy​
​until her eye’s hurt and looked like small slits.  Eventually the chill from being​
​outside would override her curiosity. However, on one such occasion just as she​
​was about to close the journal, the name Michael popped out.  Lillya could barely​
​contain herself.  What would she find she wondered?​
​New chapter-childhood*******​

​35​
​Born the daughter of a maid, Natasha couldn’t help but feel that she had been​
​misplaced. Her quick wit was apparent to anyone who met her, and it seemed​
​impossible for her to keep it entirely to herself. She recognized how lucky she was​
​to have been placed in Yuri’s household on this beautiful estate and to have become​
​Lillya’s best friend.​
​Lillya’s father Yuri was very generous, and on some deep level, Lillya saw that he​
​felt bad for Natasha and his compassion made her love him more. He left books for​
​her to read, under her pillow. Each time Natasha found a new book she would​
​devour it, staying up late at night until her eyes got weary and she could no longer​
​lift her head.​
​Thinking about her station in life only got her depressed so she focused on other​
​things, like pleasing Lillya and Yuri.​
​Lillya and Natasha became inseparable and Natasha hoped it would never end.​
​Lillya, not one to look too far down the road, did not see that life would eventually​
​take them down different paths. Though Lillya’s father Yuri knew that day would​
​come. In the meantime he believed he was doing something good.  He gave​
​Natasha a good home where she could be educated, challenged, and cared for, and​
​he gave his daughter a best friend and confidant, whom she could love and trust.​

​36​
​***​
​Lillya’s mother had been ill as long as Lillya could remember, though once in a​
​while the doctors would let her come home. When they did, everyone would be on​
​pins and needles waiting for the moment the symptoms of her anxiety would begin​
​again. She would shake and sweat just a little bit and that would last for several​
​days. The nurses would wipe her brow and try to keep her comfortable and calm​
​her down with smelling salts and herbs. By the fourth night they would wrap her​
​tightly in a blanket to keep her arms pinned so she couldn’t hurt herself.​
​Lillya would toss and turn on those nights. She would sing herself to sleep while​
​trying to focus on songs that made her happy, ones with happy lyrics and melodies​
​that uplifted her. She prayed that her power of thought could be strong enough to​
​override her mother’s demons and bring about a happy ending.​
​Both girls knew what would happen next. Natasha would pull her covers down and​
​quietly make her way to Lillya’s bed, Lillya would open her blanket and let​
​Natasha in and in the morning they would awake with their arms wrapped around​
​the other.​
​Lillya’s mother, Angelina, wouldn’t shout or cry, even though sometimes they​
​wrapped her so tightly she could barely breathe. Where she was going would be​
​more comfortable for her and bring her one step closer to her life’s purpose; to be​
​god’s messenger as was written in her name, but she kept on wondering, of what?​

​37​
​In the middle of the night, Natasha and Lillya would hear the carriage wheels​
​approaching, the clop, clop of the horses’ hoofs as they got nearer. It was​
​impossible to interpret the commotion that was taking place, the low humming​
​mumbles of her father and the doctors. A groggy reply in response from her​
​mother, who earlier had been given something they called opium.  All Natasha and​
​Lillya knew was that it was strong and made her mother Angelina agreeable and​
​sleepy. Angelina’s doctor, speaking through his mustache and beard was discussing​
​something with the other doctors and Lillya’s father while the rest of the crowd,​
​that included secretly Lillya and Natasha would wait for the verdict as if each hair​
​on his mustache represented an opera fan and everyone in the theater would be​
​silent waiting to hear what the verdict would be, “Stay” or “Go” but her father​
​already knew and so did Lillya and Natasha. They would be taking her to the spa in​
​Odessa where she could rest, and hopefully get better and one day return to the​
​family for good.​
​The entire process usually only took five or six weeks. At first everything would be​
​wonderful, and Lillya would get very excited and almost believe she might have a​
​mother. But even by the age of five or six, the more it happened, and it did, again​
​and again, Lillya began to recognize the signs. She could read her mother’s body​
​language.​

​38​
​The headaches would start, then she would join the family only for lunch, then she​
​would lock herself in her room for the rest of the day. Soon she wouldn’t retreat​
​from her bedroom at all, nor receive any visitors, including Lillya. Then, almost​
​like clockwork, the sweating and shaking would begin and the following day​
​Natasha would hand Lillya a note when she opened her eyes for the day ahead, but​
​the flowers next to her bed told Lillya all that the note would say. Natasha stood​
​ready with Lillya’s robe and slippers and together they would enter her mother’s​
​bedroom. The bed would be made as if no one had ever been there, and Lillya​
​would defend her mother’s actions by repeating to Natasha what she had heard all​
​her life: her mother Angelina had a special job and she was off being a messenger​
​for God, and then Lillya, like her mother, would think, for what? For whom?​
​Lillya would ask her Grandmama, when she saw her and they were alone, where​
​her mother had really gone. Grandmama would say, “she’s with the doctors back at​
​the hospital trying to get better for you.” At least that was a partial truth. But then​
​one morning her Grandmama came to their house dressed head to toe in black.​
​Lillya did not have to ask. Her father, not grasping Lillya’s comprehension of the​
​situation, told her that her mother decided to visit God during the night and she​
​found it so peaceful and delightful that she missed the one train back home.​
​Flowers came and filled the house and Lillya laid some on her mother’s grave as​
​Lillya stood bravely next to her father with Natasha holding her hand. Later her​

​39​
​Grandmama handed her a note. I found this in your mother’s room. It simply said,​
​“tell my daughter to have a good life. We will see each other again when the angels​
​call for her many years from now.” Years later Lillya waited  for her mother in the​
​dark, but she never came.​
​New Chapter ~ 1918​
​“Perm Provence is large,” Anton recited. “Remember we will be at the mercy of​
​others. This is not a vacation.”​
​Lillya had never been to Siberia, but all Russians had heard stories of the place and​
​at times found ways to romanticize the rough life it took to survive with its unique​
​qualities, but mostly they shuddered with fear at the thought of being forced to live​
​there. Some had compared it to a batch of stew where a little of everything was​
​thrown in until it became something new. European prisoners of war mixed with​
​native Aboriginal tribesmen and they sometimes spiced the pot by throwing in a​
​Russian Jew or political exile. Then there was the Trans-Siberian Railway; workers​
​from around the world populated that path for over 15 years while they built it.​
​For a few minutes Lillya had given herself permission to daydream.  Every once in​
​a while, as Anton spoke, she caught a glimpse of her old self. The teenage girl who​
​galloped through the woods like a streak of lightning while standing upright on the​
​back of her father’s favorite stallion.​

​40​
​She and Anton had been on edge long before they had left Petrograd, a name she​
​couldn’t get used to, the new name of her beloved St. Petersburg. She had forgotten​
​what it was like to have no reason to hide.  And, oh, how Anton hated being the​
​one assigned to hold her kite string.​
​***​
​Anton had gathered a large stick at the beginning of their journey and he marked it​
​each morning to keep track of the days and time. Without it, they would have​
​gotten lost.​
​“Just one more long, grueling day,” Anton thought as he marked the twig for what​
​he hoped would be this last time. “If I’m right, by day’s end we will finally be able​
​to give that wife of mine a rest.” Having no one to talk with he had become quite​
​conversant with himself and the horses he tended to as well.​
​Lillya rarely complained.  Still, she had to admit to herself that she was looking​
​forward to sleeping in the same place, the same bed for more than one or two​
​nights and she would be happy to let her guard down a bit wherever  it was that​
​they settled when they finally settled and to wherever it was the stars and destiny​
​led them. Then she gave one giant yawn, said a quick prayer, and got down to the​
​business of the day. Soon, she would be able to spend hours tucked away with her​
​father’s journal, unraveling secrets she was positive she would find. Just thinking​
​about it, made her feel guilty.​

​41​
​1 remembering seeing the name Michael, a chill ran up and down her spine. He​
​was taking a big risk by hiding them. Maybe her father Yuri blackmailed him or​
​perhaps Michael was indebted to return a big favor? All in due time she thought,​
​smiling at Anton. Enough of their life had been torn apart. She wasn’t so certain​
​that her father had done her a favor by giving her his journal.​
​Anton recognized that smile in Lillya’s eyes however he knew it was safe not to​
​ask her what it meant.​
​For a while she had forgotten how tired her feet and legs had become, not to​
​mention her swollen ankles.  She thought about her son Vladimir and his family.​
​“Does he look like his father? Do any of his girls resemble me perhaps in spirit?”​
​Lillya missed her son horribly and she cursed her country and all of its stupid​
​political factions for the reasons he lived so far away and for the pain that she felt​
​from never having held any of her granddaughters, but Anton had been needed in​
​the early years by his parents and of course Lillya had her father Yuri. She recited​
​the names of Vladimir’s children. “Let’s see, Ann Marie Heart, Spade, Diamond​
​Claire, and Lucia Akinsya Club. The last child was named after herself, as her full​
​name was Lillya Akinsya Engelhardt. Akinsya had come from Lillya’s​
​great-grandmother, and she liked thinking there was an old Russian name that she​
​wore, too, floating around in that young country, the United States.​

​42​
​They had taken a short stop so Lillya could stretch. “If all goes well tonight we’ll​
​be sleeping in Kungur.” Anton repeated once more. Then with hopeful eyes he​
​handed Lillya the reins of the sturdy workhorse she had ridden all of these months.​
​She was a far cry from her father’s stallion. She could see a small supply of​
​hopefulness in Anton’s eyes. Things were about to change. “If we are lucky we​
​will arrive around dusk.”****​
​Lillya smiled at Anton. She was thinking of her cousin Michael. She had a vague​
​recollection of him. She met him once as a child and he had left quite an​
​impression on her like a map in her memory. She could only have been four or five​
​because her mother was still alive. They had a simple lunch together and he did not​
​stay long after the meal. She remembered that day clearly because Natasha had sat​
​next to her and her father Yuri and put the guest of honor between Natasha and​
​Lillya’s mother.​
​Lillya remembered Michael was very distinguished-looking with salt and pepper​
​hair and he had a mustache that he waxed and wore turned up. He seemed serious,​
​but then he’d tell a joke and no one laughed harder than him, and his smile would​
​suddenly grow twice as big. Then he would cough as if he were choking on his​
​own joke and laugh as if it was too big for even him. As a young girl she found​
​him very mysterious. She caught her father sometimes whispering his name. He​

​43​
​was her mother’s favorite cousin and therefore there was an air of myth that​
​surrounded him for no other reason.​
​“He’s going to be very old,” she said to Anton as he reset the bridle on her horse. It​
​had somehow gotten twisted along with her thoughts. Then suddenly a horrified​
​look covered her face. “Think of the shock he’ll have when he sees me!”  Up until​
​that moment she had forgotten about how much older she had become, too. But​
​then she remembered that all her cousin Michael would have to do would be to​
​look at her jaw and the small dimple in the middle of her chin and her painterly​
​nose with the perfect slant. “Somethings don’t change, she smiled.​
​She wore the family crest just like every other proud Englehardt. Yes, her cousin​
​would believe she was who she claimed to be. He’d be able to see it in her face.​
​She wore it as clearly as the statue of David rested his chin on his hand​
​contemplating the woes of the world.​
​New Chapter - Childhood​

​44​
​Her arms stretched out wide, the wind on her face, she spoke softly to her horse,​
​Pluto Gaetano, a gift from the Czar, her cheeks blushed bright red. She couldn’t​
​contain her excitement and with her hand covering her mouth to block the sound.​
​She howled to the chipmunks, rabbits, squirrels and all the animals of the forest.​
​Lillya had grown tired of being so secretive. She wanted the world to know what​
​they had accomplished. Her horse prepared himself. He knew what was coming​
​and he made an effort to keep an even, steady pace. He imitated her breath as if​
​they were a part of one another. Then she stood upright on Nicholas, her horse's,​
​back, and counted to eight, nine, ten. When she reached the number ten she came​
​back down again. Rocking steadily forward, she was grinning from ear to ear.​
​“Good boy,” she said to horse as she released the pressure in her knees. They came​
​to a slow steady trot, then she nestled her head into his neck, feeling all of his​
​muscles. “I'm so proud of you Nikki!  I have an apple in my pocket. I brought it​
​especially for you.” Then she gave him a hug. Suddenly she got a feeling that they​
​were being watched; as if a hunter was looking at its prey.​
​“Good boy,” she said softly to her horse again.” We’re not alone,” she mumbled​
​under her breath, but instead of being frightened, she suddenly became very bold​
​as if it were a statement of herself.​
​“Who are you and why are you in my woods?  I declare you announce yourself!”​
​There was not a sound except for some rustling in the bushes.  Then she caught a​

​45​
​glimpse of a young boy who she believed worked close by. “Not again,” she said​
​just loud enough for him to hear.​
​This was the third time the boy had come to watch her ride.  He had to have woken​
​up very early to do so as she rode every morning between eight and nine. She​
​decided he must be very shy otherwise he’d have introduced himself, so she​
​shouldn’t punish him too badly. Besides she had recently shared her new trick with​
​her father.​
​Lillya didn’t get too close, Natasha said he was smitten by her command of horses​
​and also her horse. “You are well beyond average in every way,” Natasha said.​
​“you will mesmerize many others, I just know it!”​
​“Mesmerize,” Lillya liked that word.​
​Then she became a bit angry. He knew who she was, but he was still a mystery to​
​her.​
​Lillya circled the boy with her horse. The boy followed her with his eyes as if she​
​were a crystal ball. Spinning in circles as fast as she could. Still he did not move,​
​he just seemingly grew dizzy. He was frozen.​
​“Next time plan on introducing yourself,” she yelled to the boy and then she​
​galloped off in the direction of home.​
​“Who is this boy and what does he want?” Then she smiled, realizing she enjoyed​
​the mystery.​

​46​
​Lillya began humming to herself. She liked to hum. She liked the way it felt. The​
​vibrations massaged her insides which always got a little jumbled up between her​
​equestrian tricks and the feelings she was having for a boy she had never met.  It​
​also helped to pass the time and before she knew it, Lillya was back at her father’s​
​stable and the stable boy had taken hold of the reins of the magnificent stallion.​
​Lillya couldn’t get the image of the boy in the woods out of her mind. “Maybe he​
​won’t come again,” she thought. Then she found herself hoping she was wrong. As​
​much as he angered her, he intrigued her twice that amount.​
​****​
​Lillya excelled above all the other girls her age in her ability when it came to​
​riding, but she had one thing that she kept as a secret that was an embarrassment to​
​her. She had a single large mole in the middle of her back that was shaped like a​
​heart.  Lillya felt as if she had been marked when it came to love, but she didn’t​
​know for what or why. When she was a child she and Natasha would tried to rub​
​the mole away, but as she grew older she had to come to terms with the fact it​
​wasn’t going away. “Yes, God has a plan for me,” she would say to Natasha, the​
​only person who knew. “This way he will know for certain how to find me when​
​he is ready and be certain I was the one.”​
​Lilly never met anyone besides Natasha who could replicate her own spirit.​
​Natasha was proud and pleased, but it was hard for Natasha, being so smart, to be​

​47​
​stuck in a lower station in life where nothing was expected of her. She could play​
​the piano and speak French but no one wanted to hear what she could do besides​
​Lillya.​
​To allay her frustration with people not treating others well or wanting to​
​understand their own god given gifts, Lillya rode every day. It was the only way in​
​which she filled her spirit after her mother passed away. She took out one of her​
​father’s horses and she rode him hard. Day by day she honed her talent. By age​
​twelve she had earned a reputation as a daring horsewoman. Her father had to close​
​his eyes when his young daughter practiced gymnastics on her horse behind him.​
​Natasha, too, had some questions left unanswered. Like, “Who is my father and​
​why was my beautiful, wonderful mother born into the station of a servant?” Deep​
​questions for young girls with the world in front of them.​
​Natasha tried not to think too much about the future. She believed she was living​
​her best life now, and Lillya was unwilling to admit that eventually they would be​
​forced by society to go their separate ways and develop separate lives.​

​48​
​New Chapter ~ 1918​
​After sleeping in abandoned shacks along the way to Kungar, Lillya dreamed of​
​spending an afternoon in a comfortable chair next to a window. Basking in the​
​indulgence of not having to travel every day, she imagined what it would be like to​
​have her body clean again and not have to look for a river to jump in. They had all​
​known that they would have to travel during the summer, for the winter in Kungar​
​would be the coldest weather she had ever known. She laughed when she thought​
​of all the pretty dresses she had left behind, and wondered about Alexi, her​
​dressmaker, who was now probably sewing buttons on officers’ uniforms from​
​whichever army had grabbed him first. There wasn’t much in the way of choices​
​these days. Life sort of happened to everyone and we all had to find some way to​
​wade through the muck and sludge that slowed us down or took us to someplace​
​we never would have chosen to go. But our feet made us stay, they were like​
​quicksand in dirt, and they were forced to accept these unfamiliar boundaries.​
​However, for Lillya, Kungar actually sounded exciting, for she was tired of living​
​in fear and wanted to feel as if she had some control over her life and her destiny.​

​49​
​She wished she could express all of her thoughts to Anton, but he was already​
​frightened for her and if she did, she was afraid they might scare him even more.​
​Being a noble man, Anton set very high expectations for himself and he would not​
​budge or lower them to make them easier. Sometimes Lillya would tease him about​
​his moral code, but deep down inside there was no one she would trust more with​
​her life if she had to put it in someone else’s hands. She knew he felt a huge​
​commitment to protect her, even sometimes from herself.​​(insert example)​​Now,​
​once too often, he would find himself pulling the kite string again and again.​
​“I understand that there is no time for pleasure today,” Lillya said to Anton as she​
​bent down to pick a poppy from a field close by. The rain and unusually warm​
​weather had sent everything to distract her. A golden summer breeze was working​
​its way in and would push her all the way to Kungar, she thought. “Let the wind​
​blow me and all our baggage away,” she said teasingly to Anton. “Blow me into​
​the unknown,” she continued. She could feel the string in Anton’s hand yanking​
​her back to the ground. “If only one of my father’s stallions could magically​
​appear, even for ten minutes, but I can’t afford to think like that, still sometimes I​
​can’t help myself.” Lillya quieted down. She couldn’t blame Anton for their​
​predicament, so she continued urging the workhorse forward, kicking the dirt and​
​muck aside, learning to appreciate the poppies from afar. To pass the time she​
​imagined a little house in Kungar that she would decorate and call home. The first​

​50​
​thing she saw was a large stone fireplace that rivaled the one in their townhouse in​
​St. Petersburg, but that was long ago and she knew her thought was too big. But​
​most of all, this little house in Kungar would be a place where she did not have to​
​worry. “If times weren’t so bad we’d still be at my father’s estate. But for now, I​
​need to reconcile that I can be happy with a little hint of sunlight caressing my face​
​and not feel the need to run every time a horse aproaches.” Her nose picked up a​
​foul scent, she realized it was herself. She was certain she was wretched by now​
​and Anton was too kind. Lillya smiled as thoughts ran through her head, scattering​
​like children on a playground. “Maybe our scents have blended with each other’s​
​until now we don’t know whose is whose.”​
​“Lillya, where have you been?” Anton asked, knowing quite well the answer. “We​
​need to stay very alert today and not lose sight of one another even for a minute. I​
​know it’s very hard and not in your nature darling, but today you must listen to my​
​commands. I promised your father I would get you to Kungar and Michael in safe​
​condition. And I’m not about to prove myself wrong. So I’ll need your help.”​
​“Don’t worry, my dear,” Lillya said with a wink. “Don’t you know I always listen​
​to you?”​
​Anton started to laugh with his deep belly laugh that put a smile on her face.​
​“Okay, my dear, what direction do we go from here?”​

​51​
​“We want to go northeast. Let me get my compass out.” He reached into his pocket​
​and took out the trusty compass that had once been his father’s; the one he had​
​counted on since he was a young boy. Lillya believed in it, too, for it had gotten​
​them this far.​
​“Why don’t you tell us, my dear,” Anton said.​
​Lillya tied her hair back in a bun, pretending it wasn’t even there, and then said to​
​her husband Anton, “Turn left. I too can smell the leather from the Kungar​
​factories getting near.”​
​Lilly and Anton knew so much depended upon what would happen this day. Would​
​Michael and his friends be there looking for them as her father had promised,​
​Lillya wondered. Or would he have taken her father’s money and found he had​
​better things to do than wait for a cousin he hadn’t seen in forty years who had​
​nothing to offer him but trouble and stories from the past? Anton questioned​
​whether Michael’s loyalty was strong enough and whether he was brave enough to​
​show up at the church every night for weeks on end, waiting for his cousin and her​
​husband to arrive, when he hadn’t seen her since she was a child. Anton prayed​
​that he would recognize her. But with the dimple in her chin and her perfect slanted​
​nose Lillya had no doubt that this Englehardt would recognize another.​

​52​
​Drenched in the last of what could be called summer sunlight, they continued​
​toward Kungur. A sly smile appeared on Lillya’s face. Anton didn’t want to know​
​the reason why. He could feel his wife’s heart pounding harder the closer she​
​thought they were to their destination. Wrapped up in his own thoughts, he was​
​caught completely off guard when suddenly, a boulder came rolling down the hill​
​aimed right where they were walking. Luckily, Anton had quick reflexes and was​
​used to acting on instinct just as he had been taught to do since childhood. He​
​urgently grabbed the horse’s reins and pulled them hard and quickly got them out​
​of the boulder’s path. Lillya didn’t know what was happening until she felt Anton​
​give her shirt a swift tug, changing her direction and speed and she suddenly heard​
​the sound of a giant boulder rolling past her. When it was over, she froze and stood​
​there shaking. It took a minute or two for her to register just how close she came to​
​dying. Anton had just saved her life. Standing next to Lillya, he was shaking, too.​
​The boulder had gotten very close to its target unless it had just been a fluke of​
​nature, but Anton had to think of himself as a soldier leading the cavalry, and his​
​job was to deliver precious cargo safely, without a scratch if possible. Anton didn’t​
​really want to know who or think what was behind this close call, their near​
​mishap. He wanted to make light of it and didn’t want Lillya to become more​
​frightened than she already was. Putting on his best face, he looked at Lillya with a​
​grave expression and said to her “Man can plan all he wants, but Nature is a force​

​53​
​that has its own mind and it is always going to do what it pleases and will roar as​
​loud as it wants and cause as much havoc and hardship as will fill its stomach.”​
​Lillya replied, “But luckily, my dear, I have you. Nature doesn’t know the will and​
​the force I have at my side!”​
​Anton had simply reacted. He hadn’t had time to think. Lillya slowed her breathing​
​and began to normalize. Silently, her composure returned, and her blue eyes​​(refer​
​Circus)​​began to sparkle and color returned to her​​cheeks and one could see the​
​natural beauty of her youth. She wanted Anton to know she had relaxed. That they​
​could go forward. Anton, wanting to break the hardened air that had entered the​
​circle that surrounded them, decided to tell a joke. Lillya loved that he was trying​
​to make a joke during such a serious time. For only moments before, getting to​
​Kungar could have been the least of their worries.​
​Anton knew how to focus more than anything else. Nothing could break his​
​concentration when he had somewhere to go and something to do, and in this​
​moment it was to see a smile on his wife’s face. So he continued. The Austrian​
​clown Leo told him a funny story. Amused, Anton smiled to himself when he​
​realized the coat Lillya was wearing had once been Leo’s wife’s coat. He had​
​talked to Anton about the art of illusion and how sometimes it could be more​
​powerful than the truth. And he spoke about a clown who had tried to win the one​
​and only position with a circus, but the circus had advertised that they were​

​54​
​looking for a clown who could ride a unicycle and they were interested in no​
​others.​
​The clown was so determined that even though he could not ride it, he bought a​
​unicycle and made it very visible to the owners. And because they saw the bike,​
​they did not question whether the owner knew how to ride one. He had only used it​
​as a prop, an illusion, so he would appear more useful so the circus would hire him.​
​But in reality, his finest skill was sticking a mop between his legs and running​
​around in circles as if it were a donkey who had lost his mind and didn’t know​
​which way to go. Mimicking a costumed mop to look like a donkey got more​
​laughs, anyway. With a unicycle one needed skill, a mop you just needed​
​imagination, to be able to move your limbs and be funny and give the audience​
​room to laugh. That’s what jokes are about. Giving the other space and time to find​
​something funny.​
​Lillya, not wanting to admit that she had been shaken, suggested that they stop for​
​a short period of time. They could sip some Bergamot citrus tea just like the czar​
​would be doing at this hour had he not been summering on the other side of the​
​mountain range where they would soon take refuge. Anton, fearing that the large​
​stone could have come from a misplaced soldier out for revenge, or simply wanting​
​to steal their horses, urged Lillya on by talking about the boar they might eat that​
​night, the feast they might have.​

​55​
​“A safe place where I can read my father’s journal, without drawing attention to​
​myself,” she thought. In her mind she was going over the directions her father had​
​given them.​
​“Enter the back entrance of the church when the parishioners are leaving after the​
​evening service is complete. In all that commotion it is less likely anyone will​
​notice you. Still, you must be very careful.”​
​They had fared fairly well. Their supplies had lasted and soon they would be​
​among friendly company and have the underground support of a nearby church and​
​a few of their most trusted members would help them to hide. Just thinking of it,​
​Lillya started to feel the butterflies in her belly. She could barely wait to be around​
​trusted company and sit at a proper table, drink wine and converse. Simply​
​allowing these thoughts brought back memories of her father, and she wondered if​
​he was still alive. Her father, she suspected, would be in his study waiting for the​
​soldiers’ arrival, and whether they be the red or the white he would let them know,​
​it was his patriotic duty to give up his estate to and for the people. Then if they​
​were red he planned on shouting “Comrade,” and if they were white, he would​
​offer up his very best wine.​
​Her father knew nobles that kept 300,000 serfs. “What family needs such excess?”​
​Behind closed doors Lillya recalled a conversation with her father earlier that year.​
​“They got too greedy,” he continued. “And now if they leave, they most likely​

​56​
​leave with nothing. If they are lucky and smart they hid some of their family​
​jewels. One necklace could buy them passage to America and keep them alive. I​
​hope you didn’t send every last emerald and ruby to the States and remembered to​
​keep a few for yourself and Anton.” She listened attentively but said not a word.​
​Lillya found solace in knowing their affairs with the circus and their home had​
​been settled before their world turned completely upside down. Thank goodness​
​Anton and her father were forward-thinking men. Together they had made​
​arrangements for her son Vladimir, in the United States, more than enough to​
​assure the legacy of his family and the circus.​
​Anton came from a long line of circus people and he had inherited his family’s​
​circus which was located near the Bolshoi in St. Petersburg, but that was many​
​years ago. He had since given the circus to his son, who took the circus from​
​Russia to Europe, then made a home in the southern United States traveling from​
​one town to the next. But it was Lillya, it was her pedigree the armies would be​
​most interested in. She was the reason they were running.​
​Anton and Lillya tried not to think about what had just happened. The boulder that​
​fell had scared her, but Anton was sure-footed. Even so, he wondered, was it a​
​random act of violence, was it some bored kid playing some sort of game or was it​
​a displaced soldier from the red or white army hoping that if he brought back​
​several horses and two prisoners that he might once again return to their good​

​57​
​graces? Lillya could see the thoughts jumping around in Anton’s head but she​
​knew better than to ask him, for it would only stir things up and make them feel​
​worse. They should just be grateful that nothing happened to them or their horses​
​or even the displaced boy; after all she had a son and would hope that any mother​
​would look at these almost children and think of their own progeny as well when​
​making decisions. So she quickly changed the subject and surprisingly found​
​herself speaking of Donatalia, the daughter of her old friend Katya from whom she​
​had learned this tea recipe. Katya was the first person who had ever made it for her​
​oh so many years ago. For just a few seconds she could see this young girl dressed​
​in her New Year’s best, trying not to have the son of their hostess notice she was​
​counting her forks and spoons. Trying very hard to act grown up. She could see​
​Donatalia unable to contain her excitement as Anton told one story after another.​
​Anton was in rare form that night, Lillya remembered. Standing in the open so​
​close to where the boulder could have so easily taken her life. Anton didn’t know if​
​his joke of the clown had worked, but something he had done or said he was​
​certain had triggered the smile that now appeared on her face. Lillya brought​
​herself back to where they were standing and to that exact moment in time. Visions​
​of ice castles and princesses and elephants carrying a cage disappeared when she​
​heard her husband’s voice break through the chatter that was going on in her head.​

​58​
​“I think it’s time we get back on the horses,” Anton said. “We’ve indulged in too​
​much time already.”​
​“You won’t find any disagreement here,” Lillya answered back. “I’m more than​
​ready and my feet are, too.”​
​New chapter Lillya and Natasha getting older​
​Yuri could hear giggling coming from Lillya’s room. Lillya had convinced her​
​father to put another bed in Lillya’s room for the night so she and Natasha could​
​live out their dream of being sisters. Lillya’s father had begun to worry because he​
​knew the truth of their situation, that their class difference would very soon​
​become a problem. He could shelter them as children but soon it would not be so​
​easy. Natasha would not be invited to any of the parties and events that Lillya​
​would attend, and he assumed that after a while it was going to bother Natasha to​

​59​
​dress up her best friend to go to parties while she had to stay home and clean up the​
​mess they made in the process of getting dressed. But the one thing Yuri didn’t take​
​into account was just how left out Lillya felt when all the girls would talk about​
​their mothers. They would chatter about outings with their mothers, going for tea​
​or to the seamstress with their mothers. She really missed Angelina and really​
​wished Angelina’s special job had been to just take care of her. Did the angels​
​really need her so badly?​
​Soon winter would be over and Lillya’s father had arranged a grand vacation for​
​the coming summer. He had decided that they would go to France. Besides the​
​glamor of being in France, Lillya knew that not too many girls her age were given​
​this opportunity and that it gave her something they did not have, even if they all​
​had mothers, but sadly, Natasha would not be coming with them. Her father had​
​explained that she would have a young French girl helping her with the language,​
​her clothing, the culture, her manners, and by the end of her time there, he told her​
​she would know the difference of what was good or bad, for the French were the​
​trendsetters of the world. What they said set the bar for everyone else.​
​Quietly, Yuri had thought it a good idea to begin to separate the girls without them​
​understanding it was planned. He didn’t really like the idea himself, but culture and​
​class systems were going to dictate all of their lives and so he thought taking his​
​daughter on an extended vacation might be a good start. He could think of no better​

​60​
​or kinder exciting idea than this. Yuri went on to bait Lillya, knowing her love of​
​horses, “There’s a very famous cavalry school in the Loire Valley, in the town of​
​which we will be staying, Saumur.” Then he winked at her and finished, “If you​
​mind your manners and are very good, perhaps I will find a way to arrange a tour​
​for you?” He knew when he said this it would heighten his daughter’s curiosity and​
​then she would do almost anything he wanted.​
​“Boys and horses and a famous riding academy,” Lillya silently thought. “Hmm.”​
​She had to be careful not to let the smile in her eyes take over her face. “Tell me​
​about this journey you have planned for us,” Lillya smiled mildly. Yuri had rented​
​the east wing of a Chateau in the southwestern part of France from a man named​
​Sergei who also had a great interest in horses and cultivated a small grape vineyard​
​from which he made his own wines. “The Chateau was built by a famous architect.​
​Sergei will be able to tell you the story in more detail, but unlike many of the​
​homes in that area, this one is full of light. Sergei loves to paint when he has the​
​time, and light is important to him, as is being on the water,” Yuri went on. “There​
​are very few characteristics one’s house needs to have in order to qualify as a true​
​Chateau. Here is that one exception.” Yuri paused and held his breath until he was​
​certain Lillya was sitting on the edge of her seat, her body all tense waiting to hear​
​about something large dramatic, exotic and extraordinary. “This has to be wrong,”​
​she thinks.​

​61​
​“The house must rest on the Loire River or one of its tributaries,” Yuri finally spit​
​out with much certainty.” Yuri always felt more disappointed in himself when he​
​disappointed his daughter. “Its beauty has attracted many artists and many nobles​
​have been drawn to the area like magnets.​
​“King George of France found its beauty so intoxicating he moved the entire​
​capital of France from Paris to the Loire Valley. Besides, all the nobles that were​
​already traveling to the region during the summer and spending their vacations​
​there. He just made it a little easier for them to do so.”​
​“I believe Sergei had his house fixed from top to bottom in the late 1860s, so it is​
​up to date.” Yuri smiled, “You’ll like this; it still has a small moat and a​
​drawbridge.” Yuri continued, “I’m told it has Belgian and Flemish tapestries​
​covering many of the walls, and many other beautiful pieces of art, including some​
​of his own paintings.” He sighed for a minute before continuing, “I think it sounds​
​like a picture from one of your favorite fairy tales,” Yuri told his daughter. You’ll​
​like it! But best of all, he has an unusually fine stable of horses. I believe the​
​location will appeal to your imagination, heart and soul. There are a number of​
​castles in this region. They were built as fortresses a long time ago, when they​
​were needed to keep the gentry safe. But now they are used to house very wealthy​
​families, and their horses are used for breeding, races, and contests; pleasure, not​
​fighting. You’ll see.” Then he turned around as if he were planning to move on to​

​62​
​something else but couldn’t stop himself from going on. “Some of my favorite​
​grapes are grown there.” Yuri stopped for a moment, “I wish I could just count to​
​ten and we’d be there.”​
​In late March, before their scheduled trip to France, her father finally got around to​
​making a date for them to go see the Vronsky Family Circus. Lillya was beside​
​herself.​
​“I can’t believe how excited I am,” Lillya said to Natasha. “I’m finally going to see​
​that son of theirs that no one has introduced me to. They’re not going to get away​
​with that tonight, I’m going to insist they introduce us and if I like him I’m going​
​to make Papa promise to invite him to see our stables. I’m told his name is Anton.​
​Can you imagine going out with a boy that walks a high wire!”​
​That night Lillya wore her favorite blue lace dress with a blue and yellow scarf to​
​match. It was the color of the sea at sunset with embroidered golden threads​
​running through it and burnt orange threads intertwined to accentuate the gold that​
​looked like the sun setting on the sea. She hoped her father would like Anton as​
​much as she thought she would. “Maybe he’ll invite him over to ride next​
​Sunday?” She loudly mumbled to Natasha, trying to swallow a bite of her dinner at​
​the same time. She could barely keep her food down her. Butterflies were flying so​
​rapidly in her stomach, fluttering at such a pace, she didn’t know if she could keep​

​63​
​her composure. It was if her stomach was their designated migrating ground, only​
​all the action was not between one tree and then another, but instead inside of her.​
​They were hitting the wall of her insides so hard and fast she thought one might​
​escape through her belly button.​
​When Lillya got nervous Natasha liked to tease her, but this time Natasha​
​understood the importance of this event for Lillya and decided she could goad her​
​some other time about something else.​
​The circus tent was teal blue and burnt orange with a big bright gold sign that lit up​
​the sky and it read, the Vronsky Family Circus. Located near the Bolshoi, everyone​
​in St. Petersburg knew where to find it. Dimitri and Petra Vronsky had arranged a​
​special parking place where Yuri and Lillya might park their carriage. Petra and​
​Dmitri seemed to be almost as excited as Lillya and Yuri. They knew that if Yuri​
​and Lillya spoke highly of the circus, more aristocrats and members of the upper​
​class would follow their lead. It would also help to keep them in the good graces of​
​the Czar and Czarina. Escorted to the best seats in the house, front row and center,​
​that had been draped with a beautiful purple fabric that was adorned with stars and​
​hearts of gold and deep ruby reds. Lillya noticed all the eyes in the big top tent​
​were staring at her and she couldn’t help but admit to herself that she liked it and​
​was glad she had taken the extra time getting dressed for the event. Caught in a​

​64​
​web of her own thoughts, when the tigers entered the arena she smiled at the​
​foolishness of thinking she could possibly outshine the natural beauty of their​
​coats. They were wearing the most striking silky fur she had ever seen and the​
​audience seemed to agree for their attention quickly and naturally turned from​
​herself to them. Her eyes had become fixated on the circus and nothing else, and​
​she had an instant uncontrollable pining to want to be a part of it. “What​
​magnificent creatures!” Lillya said to her father, poking his elbow until he listened​
​to her. She already had a special affinity for them, having heard Petra speak of​
​them at dinner. “Their names are Midnight and Satin,” she said to him as if she had​
​been the only one who had heard the conversation. And just at that exact moment​
​their trainer brought them within a breath of their proximity. Midnight opened his​
​mouth as if to show off his prize-winning sharp teeth. Satin, attached to Midnight,​
​came so close to them that Lillya felt as if she could almost touch her. And quicker​
​than she could process what had just happened, in walked the elephants. Lillya had​
​never seen such big creatures. And at the top of one of the elephants, dressed in​
​purple satin, was Petra, whose arms, though long, were impossible to wrap around​
​the big elephant’s neck. After several tricks and a roar of applause from the​
​audience, Petra quickly changed clothes and entered the ring playing a flute while​
​standing upright on her horse’s saddle with a big red feather plume popping out of​
​the thick satin deeper red headband. Lillya smiled at her father. Petra’s outfit was a​

​65​
​bit risqué but she was so brilliant in her moves and the way she commanded her​
​horse that no one could refer to her as cheap or inappropriate. They could only​
​stare at her in amazement and awe.​
​Then the moment arrived. Twenty-five feet up in the air was the boy she had​
​admired from conversation. She had never seen him. A little shorter and stockier​
​than she had thought for such a position, but seemingly kinder and cooler than she​
​imagined possible for someone about to embark on such a treacherous feat. Her​
​heart started to rattle and shake so loud she was afraid her father might hear it. By​
​the time he started juggling plates and had walked to the other side, she was​
​already on her feet ready to give a standing ovation. Realizing how anxious she​
​must look, she sat down. That night when the circus ended, Petra Vronsky arranged​
​a little table to be put into one of the smaller tents and invited Yuri and Lillya to​
​join them for some Schnapps, Vodka and pastry. The tent had a nice golden glow​
​that comforted Lillya. Still, she was a bit nervous and her father knew it. “Only a​
​sip,” Yuri reminded Lillya. “Just wet your lips.” Earlier, Yuri had teased Lillya,​
​saying that he had told Petra they couldn’t come because it would be too late for​
​his daughter. Lillya turned beet red and just about burst until she realized her father​
​was joking.​
​It turned out Lillya was the opposite of shy when it came to Anton Vronsky. Her​
​tongue wiggled and waggled one sentence, paragraph, page after another. “He was​

​66​
​so easy to talk to,” she told Natasha later that evening. “I’ve never talked to​
​someone as smart as he that was close to our age. I think I might be in love.”​
​Natasha had a pot of chamomile tea waiting for their return, knowing she would​
​have to calm Lillya down. “Why are we going to stupid France,” Lillya said later​
​that night to Natasha.  She knew she didn’t mean it. Any girl would give her​
​eyeteeth to have a summer in France, walk the Champs-​Élysées​,​​visit the Cadre​
​Noir in Saumer, live among the castles most others would visit, for the Loire​
​Valley was known to have some of the largest and most beautiful Chateaux in the​
​world. “The one summer I would want to stay home, father insists we go, and he’s​
​not about to change his plans!” Natasha could not feel sorry for Lillya. Oh, how​
​she wished she could go in her place. But that night when Lillya closed her eyes,​
​the only one she could see was Anton. Hypnotized by his confidence and talent, he​
​was throwing one plate and then another higher and higher.​
​Natasha could hear Lillya tossing and turning. She was excited and happy by​
​Lillya’s excitement and joy but she couldn’t help think about where all of this​
​might leave her. Was this the beginning of what she knew one day would come?​
​What she had been so fearful of coming? And Lillya would turn 16 while in​
​France, without Natasha by her side.​
​The next morning when Natasha went downstairs to get Lillya’s breakfast, she​
​noticed that flowers and a note had already been dropped off for Lillya, she could​

​67​
​only guess who they were from. But just then, Yuri walked into the kitchen. An​
​unusual thing for him to do. He had noticed the flowers, too, and could only​
​imagine what Natasha was thinking.​
​“You know these are not from Anton,” Yuri told Natasha. Almost feeling he was​
​betraying his daughter, he whispered, “These are from Petra.” This made the two​
​of them even more curious.​
​Yuri followed Natasha up the steps with Lillya’s breakfast, the flowers and the​
​note. When they walked into Lillya’s room after first knocking and Lillya saw the​
​flowers on her tray, before she had a second to open her mouth, Yuri blurted out,​
​“Isn’t this lovely? You got flowers and a note from Petra.” You could see the​
​disappointment immediately cross Lillya’s face. However, all three in attendance,​
​including Lillya, knew that if anything was to go any further it would have to start​
​with the parents, and in her case it would have to begin with the boy’s mother.​
​“Why don’t you open the note, my dear,” Yuri said as Natasha handed her some​
​fresh juice. “Dear Lillya,” it read. “Dmitri and I and Anton were so pleased to have​
​had your company last evening. We know that when it comes to animals, you love​
​horses most of all, so I hope the circus did not bore you.” Lillya interrupted and​
​looked at her father and Natasha and said, “how could anyone be bored by the​
​circus, it was the most fabulous show I have ever seen.” Lillya paused for a second​
​and went on, “I could have given each of them two standing ovations! They were​

​68​
​magnificent, weren’t they Papa?” Natasha coughed into her hand then picked up​
​the note and said politely, looking at Lillya and Yuri, “May I continue? There’s​
​more.” Petra invited Lillya to go riding with her. Lillya could pick out any horse​
​she wanted from their stable to ride that day. And she wanted to know if Lillya​
​could be available to ride two days from the current day. Lillya’s head was about to​
​burst once more and before Yuri could express his thoughts, his daughter penned a​
​short note saying yes, yes, yes!​
​Lillya couldn’t wait for the day to come. She played games with Natasha and let​
​Natasha win just so Natasha would keep playing and she could keep herself​
​occupied. She picked flowers and arranged them in beautiful vases, then brought​
​out her watercolors and painted in a little sunroom off of the kitchen until the light​
​left the sky and she could barely see. When it got too chilly, she continued to paint​
​the pictures through the dining room window close to the large stone fireplace.​
​Mostly, she was certain she would see Anton again. Each time she thought of him,​
​chills rippled like a cool spring stream up and down her spine.​
​Natasha helped Lillya get dressed for Petra. She put on a beautiful pale yellow​
​dress that had a scarf that went with it that was stamped with purple orchids. Lillya​
​loved orchids. For Anton she would have Natasha gather flowers from the gardener​
​in the greenhouse and put the flowers in her hair. About to walk out the door to​
​grab some air so she would look fresh when Petra’s carriage arrived to take her to​

​69​
​their stable, a rider unexpectedly approached the house asking for Lillya. He was​
​carrying a note. It was from Anton. “Dear Lillya,” it said “I am sorry, but I have​
​been called away to answer business directed at my father. I’m sorry we will not​
​have a chance to formally get together before I leave. Today is the day I have to go.​
​I’m afraid it may be some time before we have another opportunity to exchange​
​thoughts and ideas. My mother has explained to me that you will be leaving for​
​France before my return. I find it sad that timing could get so in the way of​
​discovering who you really are. This may be quite forward of me, but I’m​
​wondering if you would meet for a few minutes right now? I know it won’t be for​
​very long.” The expression on Lillya’s face completely changed and she began to​
​read silently, keeping the words from Anton between only the two of them. “Could​
​you meet me in five or ten minutes behind your father’s barn? I can’t bear the​
​thought of not speaking to you without getting one word in right before I lose you​
​to the horses and boys of France.”​
​Lillya then looked at Natasha with pleading eyes, then showed her the note. “Will​
​you help, Natasha?” Lillya asked. Natasha, knowing Lillya’s stubborn streak, and​
​that Lillya would go with or without her, nodded her head yes.​
​Lillya’s father was back in his library working away, so Lillya had a short window​
​of time to do as she pleased, but she knew she’d better move fast. Natasha ran to​
​grab Lillya’s hand and together they quickly ran behind the barn paying no​

​70​
​attention to the stable boys. Several minutes later, Lillya could hear footsteps​
​coming up from behind. Trying to remain calm, she took a breath and then three​
​others. Natasha took both her hands into her own and just that action alone helped​
​her heart retain its normal beat. Not knowing what to say when Anton arrived, she​
​simply remained silent. Lillya and Anton shyly embraced. Lillya knew his​
​thoughts. She knew he would wait for her while she was in France. Quickly, he​
​kissed her on the cheek, a typical French greeting, but his lack of words told her​
​everything. Then he turned towards her with a big smile on his face, jumped on his​
​horse and left.​
​Lillya tried to take a step forward but almost fell back. Then she looked at Natasha​
​and said, “It’s a good thing I don’t walk the rope.” Natasha started laughing and​
​gathered Lillya’s things and together they headed back toward the house. Lillya’s​
​head was spinning. “He kissed me,” she whispered. “He kissed me!” When Petra’s​
​carriage arrived she was much more silent than she would have normally been. Her​
​head was somewhere else as she played that last scene with Anton over and over as​
​if they were rehearsing the final scene of a play in a theater. Petra, a smart female,​
​sensed the feelings behind Lillya’s demeanor and said to herself, “I have no doubt​
​my son had something to do with this.”​

​71​
​New Chapter​
​The scare with the boulder left both Lillya and Anton tense. They didn’t have​
​much farther to go, but anything could happen. Anton tried to remind himself of​
​this each step that they took and tried to remind Lillya too, without being too pesty.​
​He told her, “Probably only four or five hours more to go before we arrive at​
​Kungar.” Kungar was their final destination, for now at least. Still, he didn’t want​
​to get Lillya’s hopes up too high. The closer they got, the harder their journey​
​seemed to become. It felt almost impossible. Lillya didn’t know time could move​
​so slowly. But looking at the sun and the way it was positioned in the sky and the​
​speed they were traveling, Anton felt fairly certain they would make it. Besides, he​
​couldn’t bear the thought of his wife sleeping outdoors for one more night.​
​Lillya had put on a good face. She didn’t want to show Anton how frightened she​
​had been by many of the obstacles they encountered along the way, especially the​
​boulder. Yet she couldn’t stop her mind from thinking what could happen if they​
​were found out. (*** She felt guilty for having gotten Anton into this upper-class​
​cauldron of trouble***). She thanked God for having made her a woman***(for​

​72​
​the worst that would happen to her would be prison, but a man would most likely​
​be sent to the front lines and certain death.​
​“Besides, what would they want with me?” ***) Lillya had created numerous​
​internal conversations with many imaginary people since they left. It made sense​
​since there was nothing to do but to walk and talk. Each step they took was​
​bringing them closer to a new life, like it or not. However, Lillya had made up her​
​mind to make the best of it. “What else can I do?” she said. Out of nowhere, a bolt​
​of lightning lit the sky and thunder shook the earth****. She tried to think of what​
​horrible deed had been done to make God so angry. She was certain it was a man’s​
​doing.​
​“We don’t need this,” Anton said out loud, seeming to try to make up for the​
​mishaps of his gender as the ***rain fell like pennies from the sky. In big circular​
​drops that could have passed for cherries.​
​Lillya was upset because the rain was ruining the game she had had made up to​
​keep her mind occupied. She liked to guess how many steps they had taken, since​
​the last time she added them up, but for now the rain was rinsing them away. The​
​footsteps had been witness to their journey and the rain was erasing the evidence of​
​all her hard work. So instead she found herself becoming transfixed by the sounds​
​of the little bubbles that were popping underneath her feet as the rain made its way​
​into the earth.​

​73​
​It felt childlike making up games like this, but she had to find a different way of​
​dealing with time and learning patience along the way. Now the stakes were too​
​high to be playing make-believe. For the gameboard her father and the other men​
​set up made there no time for frivolity, this was life and death!​
​Anton knew he had no choice but to trust the plan that Lillya’s father had set up for​
​them with Lillya’s mother’s cousin. By now they were in too deep and no one else,​
​friends or relatives, seemed to owe her father a bigger favor, a favor of the​
​magnitude of what they’d be asking someone to do. Walking in the rain, the sound​
​of the little bubbles continued popping under her feet. When Anton had estimated​
​they were about an hour from Kungar and the church, Lillya reached into her bag​
​and pulled out an old scarf to tie around her head. She’d be able to tuck her hair​
​inside of it, covering up most of her gray and helping her to disguise her true​
​identity. They started to see other travelers on the path going in the opposite​
​direction. Lillya wondered why they were leaving, but didn’t dare try to venture​
​into any sort of conversation or recognition more than a nod.​
​Testing his memory, Anton began to recite Yuri’s instructions to the church. “You​
​will go to​​the lower part of the town,” her father​​continued. “On Kittarskaya Street​
​is the Uspenskaya Church. Your mother’s cousin Michael is friends with the parish​
​priest.”​​He repeated them over and over until finally​​the church came into view.​
​Both became more cautious as they inched in closer to their final destination.​

​74​
​Lillya grabbed her husband’s hand, unable to anticipate what could happen next.​
​The congregation was chanting a familiar song from Lillya’s childhood (find name​
​of song). Lillya was about to whisper something to Anton when he put his finger to​
​her mouth, signaling her to be quiet. “Shhhh” he said to his wife. “We must stay​
​very quiet, my love.  Michael will find us.’​
​Lillya bit her tongue. Anton motioned for her to stay put. He wanted to check out​
​their surroundings.​
​Lillya wasn’t too pleased. Happily, Anton returned a few minutes later with news.​
​“There’s a big brush of blackberry bushes close by.” And he pointed to the left​
​where there was an old gardening shed. “I think that will provide some cover this​
​time of day,” he said after seeing a questioning look in Lillya’s eyes.​
​“The hymn, the one they’re singing, I sang it as a girl.” She smiled, hoping to​
​lighten the mood. “It was our closing hymn. No time to deliberate. I think we’d​
​better get ready the congregation will charge through that front door very soon.”​
​********************add material​
​Anton and Lillya found their way to the blackberry brush by the shed.​
​“Do you think Michael will be here tonight?” Lillya asked.​
​“I don’t know, my love, but if not he will have sent someone in his place. Don’t​
​worry. He’s going to take very good care of you. Of that I am sure!”​

​75​
​Anton had tried to keep his own questioning to himself, afraid that the power of​
​doubt would prove him right.​
​“Anyway, there is no turning back.” Anton said softly. He noticed an old beggar​
​out of the corner of his eye. The beggar nodded in recognition. Anton just ignored​
​him.​
​Anton gave Lillya a peck on her cheek to assure her. “Everything’s going to be​
​fine,” he whispered and squeezed her hand. Wanting in some way to acknowledge​
​how far they had come, Lillya lightly kissed him on the lips.​
​Lillya’s and Anton’s intimacy did not stop the beggar from coming closer. The old​
​man motioned to Anton, wanting them to move closer to him. But Anton and​
​Lillya stayed put. For a second, Lillya drifted to thoughts of her son Vladimir. She​
​wondered how many obstacles he had had to cross to make his new home. And for​
​a second; for a minute would be too painful, she imagined her granddaughters,​
​whom she had never had a chance to meet.​
​“How horrible,” Lillya thought, “that men and politics break up so many families​
​by starting wars.” But when thinking of Vladimir, she felt a sense of satisfaction,​
​for she believed they had done what was necessary to secure that he and his family​
​were safe.​
​The people from the church scattered. A few went behind the church where Lillya​
​and Anton were. Lillya heard some coughing from behind. She jumped and made a​

​76​
​small jerky motion. Hoping no one noticed her, she turned only to see the beggar.​
​Lillya decided to pay him no attention. Her sights were on someone else.​
​The parishioners out front of the church were seemingly starting to scatter and a​
​pain of fright mixed with abandonment kicked her in the belly. The beggar, the​
​only one vying for their attention, became annoying.​
​Anton whispered into Lillya’s ear, “He might have had other things to do tonight.​
​It’s not as if he was given a specific date of our arrival. He’s probably been outside​
​this church the last three nights and decided to take a break, and didn’t want to​
​appear more religious than he is? Anton tried to reassure his wife. “We’ll wait a​
​little longer, but if he doesn’t show up tonight, don’t lose faith, my dear. Your​
​father would never put a plan in motion that involved your life without almost 100​
​percent certainty that it would work out.  If necessary, we will have to go back into​
​the forest for one more night.”​
​Anton could see the sadness on her face; the disappointment of no reward, when​
​suddenly the parish priest approached them with the beggar at his side.​
​Without wasting a breath, he introduced himself, then instructed the beggar to take​
​over the reins of Anton and Lillya’s horses and to follow him. All Lillya and Anton​
​knew was that they needed to listen. The parish priest was the key to their future.​
​They walked down a dark, small dirt lane and eventually stopped in the back of  a​
​carriage house that looked like all the others they had passed, only this one had a​

​77​
​small cross embedded in the wooden door, allowing them to enter the premises.​
​Lillya noticed a small lantern lit in the window and a strong green vine that was​
​growing up the sides of the structure as if to frame the building like a painting.​
​Lillya took a step back to take in the broader view. Upstairs looked to be a place​
​where people could sleep and live and downstairs was clearly a place to rest their​
​horses and belongings. “We can talk inside,” the priest said softly. “And pardon​
​me, by the way, my name is Nikolai.” Finally, Anton and Lillya knew the name of​
​the parish priest.​
​“You will be quite comfortable here and out of the way,” the priest continued.​
​“Still, always take the back road when you are coming and going. Your cousin​
​Michael will come here in the morning with his wife Gretta and my wife Helena.​
​His house is down the street, but you will be safer here, staying with me in our​
​home,” he said directly to Anton. “No one would dare question or disturb the​
​parish priest. Your husband will be known as my cousin,” he continued saying.​
​Lillya had not realized before now, seeing the priest in the soft lantern light, how​
​young he was. “How brave is he,” she thought, “for helping his friend Michael’s​
​family.”​
​“There are some clean blankets on the bed,” he said when they had climbed the​
​steps and entered the door to what would be Anton and Lillya’s new home. It was​
​small and simple, but clean and cozy, and it had one small window with a table and​

​78​
​chair in front of it that would gather the southern light. Lillya smiled when she saw​
​it. Anton, seeing Lillya happy, smiled too. “There is fruit and bread and a hard​
​piece of meat that you can cut. We weren’t quite certain when you’d arrive.​
​Michael will be happy to receive this news. I will see you in the morning.” Anton​
​thanked the priest, gave the beggar some change and went back upstairs to help his​
​wife settle in.​

​79​
​New chapter​
​“My dear, you’re quite a rider. I knew you were talented, but I didn’t realize you​
​were better than me,” laughed Petra. Lillya and Petra were returning the horses to​
​Petra’s groom. The groom spoke out, “You rode ‘em hard, Miss Petra. He’s going​
​to need a good brushing today.” He winked at Lillya, “You didn’t have anything to​
​do with this, did you?”​
​“No, I would never ride a horse so hard.”​
​“Oh no, not you,” the groom said with a smile.​
​Petra looked at Lillya and the groom and started to laugh.​
​“I think, Ivan, there might be a new member to the circus one day soon.” Ivan,​
​besides being a groom by day and overseeing the stables, got to perform at night​
​swallowing fire. Yes, he was the fire eater and loved learning new tricks, but he​
​practiced those far away from the stables and simply talked to the horses about his​
​accomplishments but never showed them what he could do.​
​Lillya was flying as high as a kite when she got back home. She barely said hello​
​to him when she ran up the stairs about to burst, yelling for Natasha. “His mother’s​
​amazing!”​

​80​
​“Calm down, Lillya, calm down. I’m certain she’s wonderful, but we have all night​
​to discuss her.”​
​Lillya, with a sullen face, walked out. Terribly disappointed, Natasha didn’t seem​
​to take her crush on Anton as seriously as she did.​
​Natasha was playing with the nightclothes in Lillya’s closet and was deliberately​
​making a lot of noise to cover up the sound of Lillya’s happy voice. Lillya had​
​been gone all day enjoying something while she had stayed home cleaning out the​
​bathtub. She knew it was her duty, but when would that change?​
​But in truth, Natasha had actually had quite a bit of fun while Lillya was out, but​
​she didn’t want Lillya to know it. For a few moments it was better, Natasha​
​thought, for Lillya to think that she had stayed home lonesome and bored, but it​
​was far from the truth. Lillya’s father Yuri wanted to surprise his daughter and had​
​hired one of the best French seamstresses in all of St. Petersburg to make some​
​new dresses for his daughter to take to France, and the seamstress had asked for​
​one more fitting. Instead of sending Lillya, her father sent Natasha.​
​The dressmaker, like anyone dealing with the upper crust of Russian society, spoke​
​only in French to Yuri, assuming Natasha, a maid, would not know a word of the​
​aristocratic language spoken amongst themselves, meant to help separate the​
​working classes from the elite. Natasha smiled when Yuri winked at her, for with​

​81​
​her photographic memory she had memorized all of Lillya’s studies throughout the​
​years, including her almost perfect French accent.​
​For several hours Natasha could almost believe this was her life, that of the​
​mistress and heiress instead of a handmaid. The dressmaker and Yuri left the room​
​to discuss fabric and prices. Natasha caught a glimpse of herself in a large silver​
​plate and gave herself a big smile of approval. Yuri returned with fabric in one​
​hand, but in his other hand he now carried a box filled with jewels.​
​You can pick one for yourself he told Natasha and one for Lillya.​
​Out of loyalty and love, Yuri noticed she pick the nicest piece for his daughter​
​By the time dinner was through, both Lillya and Natasha had let go of their​
​artificial disappointments in the other. Besides, Lillya would be leaving for France​
​in one week’s time.​
​Natasha knew that she would be missing her best friend. And Lillya felt the same​
​way, too. Natasha was like her sister and she couldn’t imagine being without her​
​for any length of time and she couldn’t get Anton off her mind. “He was so bold,”​
​she thought. He came to my father’s home, asked me to meet him secretly and​
​gave me a kiss.”​
​Without a mother to help raise his daughter, Lillya understood that her father had​
​become more open-minded then many fathers. He wasn’t trying to hold himself up​
​as the example of Russian society. After all the sadness he had seen his wife​

​82​
​endure, he wanted nothing more than happiness for his daughter. Educated by some​
​of the best French teachers in all of St. Petersburg, she had been tutored and raised​
​to fit into society, and therefore Natasha secretly believed, so had she.​
​He branded her with his lips, Lillya reflected on Anton. She couldn’t get the​
​feelings and what they meant off of her mind nor wash it away. She wanted some​
​distraction. She wanted some laughter and fun.​
​Natasha felt a bit worried for Lillya because she could read Lillya’s sparkling​
​(***check w/Circus. Green?)***green eyes and they were saying trouble. Lillya​
​had no inkling of the foreshadowing Natasha saw because she was at a point and​
​an age in which nothing was taken too seriously and little was more than a game​
​until it wasn’t.​
​(talk about the French influence around 1875 – architecture, artists and​
​philosophers)  **figure out their best transportation option from St Petersburg to​
​France)​

​83​
​The French had infiltrated Russia with their art, their dance, their drama and their​
​food by now. Although the Russians were getting stronger in their dance it was​
​hard for anyone to beat out the French, but it didn’t stop everyone from trying.​
​Her father set up reservations on an ocean liner (what kind of ship would it be?)​
​Yuri’s planned trip was suddenly in competition with young love and he found​
​himself describing the beauty of where they would be traveling as if he were a​
​famous French painter wanting to entice a museum or a buyer. “One of the most​
​famous Chateaux in the Valley: Chateau de la Chance.  It sits on the bank of the​
​Layon River and was built in the 11​​th​​century and​​flowers and artichokes line the​
​river, as do beautiful grape vines that are later pressed into some of my favorite​
​wines.”​
​“Mmmm,” Lillya said with a big approving smile on her face. Yuri knew he would​
​not have to work very hard for his daughter’s approval on where they would be​
​going and with whom they would be staying.​
​The difficulty would be in separating his daughter from Natasha and this new​
​blood and excitement she found jiggling inide her senses. She could see that her​
​father was even more excited than she to be taking this trip. It was the place he felt​
​he belonged more than anyplace other than his own home. He saw the land, its rich​
​beauty and perfect soil, as a part of him, a part of himself. It was in his blood, the​
​marrow of his bones, and this connection acted like a carrier pigeon, programmed​

​84​
​to always bring him home. But while Lillya’s mother was still alive, she made him​
​promise that he would never abandon their Russia and he would always do​
​whatever was necessary to keep Lillya in Russia, steeped in Russian culture and​
​heritage.​
​Lillya was overwhelmed by the stories of the beauty and largeness of these French​
​castles her father described and the many others that had been built in this region.​
​She had seen wealth before, but the way her father described the natural passion​
​and joy these people seemed to possess, they sounded magical.​
​The French had influence in Russia from art to architecture and became the​
​standard bearers on what was considered good. So any young Russian girl would​
​be more than thrilled to be able to experience the culture and be able to say that she​
​walked the Champs-​Élysées​​in Paris and say it was​​more beautiful than she could​
​have imagined.  Even though their destination would be Saumur, Yuri knew that he​
​had to plan their transportation to include a short stay in Paris, too.​
​There were two ways of luxury travel between St. Petersburg and the Loire Valley,​
​and Yuri decided he would indulge his daughter in both. They would take a luxury​
​suite in a steamship to the Loire Valley, passing through the Baltic Sea and then​
​going around Denmark, eventually landing in the French Port of Bordeaux. There​
​he would have a caravan of stagecoaches waiting to take them to their final​

​85​
​destination of Saumur, France, home of the famed equestrian academy, the Cadre​
​Noir.​
​The steamship was quite entertaining, but Lillya preferred land over sea. Her​
​stomach gurgled constantly and her father carried a bucket and walked beside her,​
​but she enjoyed herself nonetheless and enjoyed daydreaming in her suite.​
​With each breath Lillya took, St. Petersburg seemed to be farther away and their​
​house in St. Petersburg, which had always been considered large, would soon feel​
​small.​
​Lillya and her father arrived at the Chateau d’____ just as the women were​
​finishing airing out the rooms one after another one more beautiful than the other.​
​Exotic lanterns adorned the home with their tulip fresco engraved flowers that later​
​Lillya discovered let off a deep dripped oil of golden yellow that in its center​
​almost looked orange. Tulips seemed to be in every room and on the grounds they​
​were going to inhabit.​
​Lillya couldn’t help but think about the story of the man who swallowed a tulip​
​bulb, not realizing its worth. Lillya felt sorry for the man who had been made a​
​fool of.​

​86​
​There was laughter echoing from the dining room when Lillya and her father​
​arrived. Then two little boys who were playing tag and hide-and-seek using large​
​marble statues and a giant marble vase to shield themselves came tromping in.​
​They had no idea that their playground was at all unusual until their father walked​
​in and reminded them to mind their manners. “Silence!” he barked. “I promised​
​your mother I’d teach you to behave.” Yuri and Lillya found the situation funny.​
​Sergei, the children’s father, had wanted to make a nice impression on the father​
​and daughter who had come such a distance to rent the east wing of his Chateau for​
​the following few months. Still, he knew his boys had charm enough to win over​
​any crowd, let alone that of a tired teenaged girl who had been cooped up on a ship​
​for days, no matter how luxurious their suite was.  “What’s that dirt you have on​
​the bottom of your pants and on your shirt?” their father asked. “I’m certain Vanya​
​will be quite disappointed – she put a lot of care into dressing  you this morning.”​
​But clearly the little boys carried no guilt or fear.​
​Sergei winked at Vanya as she entered the room.​
​Having heard Sergei, she chimed in, strengthening their father’s case. “Yes, your​
​father’s right, you make me so sad that I could almost cry.” Vanya exaggerated her​
​movements and the tone of her voice to pretend she was quite serious.​

​87​
​Taking Vanya seriously, Aleksi and his little brother Stassi apologized.  And from​
​this opening moment, Lillya knew that these two sweet boys would liven up her​
​stay in France.​
​Lillya smiled and said hello, then followed her new handmaid Anika up the stairs​
​where a bath had been drawn and was waiting for her. The water had been heated​
​in big cauldrons over the fire and was mixed with ice cold creek water from behind​
​the house to get just the right temperature. While she was bathing, Anika pulled out​
​little sacks of lavender that she had made in anticipation of Lillya’s arrival. After​
​putting them in each of Lillya’s drawers when she removed Lillya’s clothing from​
​each of her suitcases, she smiled with a look of great satisfaction, for this was the​
​first step towards helping Lillya not only speak French but smell French like all the​
​other girls in her class.​
​Lillya figured Anika was probably only ten years older than herself, and even in​
​her work clothes you could see she had a nice figure.​
​When speaking French, Anika’s vocabulary and the way she put her words​
​together – was far superior to her own facility of the language. Someone had taken​
​the time to educate her, for she spoke English and Russian too. Clearly Anika was​
​more than a handmaid. “I could learn a few things from these French girls,​
​especially this one,” Lillya said to herself.​

​88​
​Lillya made it a part of her daily routine to ask Anika questions about herself, such​
​as if she was married or had a boyfriend. And Anika made a point of teaching​
​Lillya the finer points of escargot, duck cooked in plum sauce, but mostly how to​
​carry the scent of lavender wherever she went. Every night, Anika put out a bowl​
​of lavender and little bags to the side, for Lillya had become fond of making her​
​own little bags, and if she didn’t get around to it, Anika made certain there was one​
​in each of Lillya’s drawers when she woke up in the morning. “Now you’ll smell​
​like a real French girl,” she would smile, and Lillya couldn’t help but smile back.​
​Anika slowly introduced her to all of the different rooms in the house. One sitting​
​room with a big oak desk and stained glass cut windows was dedicated to the style​
​of Peter Carl Faberg​é​, a Russian jeweler of French​​descent. The artist, unable to​
​replicate the exact working of this famous artist, decided to make a wall clock and​
​titled it “For Faberg​é​​Time Will Tell It All”. It​​reminded Lillya of St. Petersburg.​
​The east wing of the Chateau, thought Lillya, “Father and I will live quite well​
​here.”​
​Though many miles from home, Anton became the picture Lillya saw when she​
​closed her eyes at night. “Anton had somethings special,” Lillya wrote Natasha,​
​and she imagined the crowd cheering as he tossed plates into the air with each step​
​he took. It sent chills down Lillya’s spine, but Lillya had large ambitions of her​

​89​
​own. She was a daring young woman and boys sought out the chance to catch a​
​glance of this special girl.​
​Anton cursed his parents privately for sending him away just as he was meeting the​
​one girl that he thought could make him happy.​
​There were many boys who had much more to offer than Anton Vronsky, as far as​
​society was concerned, but Lillya’s fear of heights when she saw him at the top of​
​a rope made her want him more, for he had conquered her greatest fear. Lillya and​
​her father would be gone a long time, and she wondered if some other girl might​
​capture his imagination in her absence. Natasha had reassured her that would be​
​impossible. “There’s no one more interesting or talented than you!” and she​
​believed it, so Lillya did, too.​
​And then there was the food. Escargot and pheasant and later the pear tartes. How​
​would she describe all of this to Natasha? Oh, how she wished she could come,​
​too. How would she explain the temperament of the people or why they serve so​
​many courses in one meal? And breakfast, they call it petit d​é​jeuner. Why,​
​according to Papa, there is nothing small about it.​
​“Oh,” thought Lillya, “it’s so different!”​
​With all this beauty, luxuries, and delicious foods, it doesn’t seem to calm the​
​people from getting high-strung or having passionate arguments in all their​

​90​
​conversations right in the middle of dinner. “Not because they are angry, but​
​because they feel strongly about something,” her father explained.​
​“They seem to have an uncanny internal clock to tell when the raspberries and​
​crème​​brûlée​​is about to be served, because they are​​always smiling by the time​
​dessert is in the air,” her father continued. “They don’t seem to fight, really, they​
​just value good, hearty conversation.”​
​***FILLER STUFF and educated people and papa seems to be a pro at this. They​
​love hearing him speak. I think some of it has to do with his Russian accent. He​
​speaks French very well and is well versed in poetry which he throws in to show​
​off. I think he might be having too much fun already.​
​“Sergei and his family have owned their chateau for several hundred years. He and​
​his wife are letting me ride one of their prize horses for the duration of our trip. I​
​can’t believe I have gone so long without talking about my horse, beautiful​
​stallion, Whisper. I’m going to explore some new trails with Papa I’m sure I’m​
​going to have many adventures while I’m here.”  **** END​
​Lillya began to imagine what the next months might bring and the more she​
​thought of the present, the smaller the past became. It’s not that she loved Natasha​
​a lesser amount, it was just that there were so many new things around her to think​
​about and the culture was so different that she couldn’t help but get engaged.​

​91​
​She had been told he was given his name because of the way he galloped down a​
​path always quiet and smooth. And they liked the sound of this English word and​
​its translation, too.​
​In the Loire Valley ou could actually smell the land as it flew off of his hoofs.​
​Yuri and his friends sat in the library and drank and played cards at night. Lillya​
​was certain he was having a good time. “I wonder what kind of life he leads when​
​we’re asleep at night in St. Petersburg,” she wrote Natasha. “I think he’s too​
​handsome and probably too full of life to have kept to himself all these years. I​
​wonder why I never gave him credit for being more than a father. To me he’s just​
​Papa. But for the first time, I’m seeing that he’s more than that to others. And I​
​guess it’s only in this land of romance and passion that I can even think about my​
​father in this way. It just makes me question everyone, even myself.”​

​92​
​Kungar Chapter Arrival (cont)​
​******​
​Anton was already out taking care of the horses when two women approached the​
​carriage house gently knocking on the door. “My name is Helena,” one said.​
​“Nicolai is my husband and I’ve brought you a few things for the house. With me​
​is Gretta, your cousin Michael’s wife,” and with that Lillya smiled and opened the​
​door. The women kissed Lillya on both cheeks as was the custom, and Lillya​
​responded by introducing herself.​
​“Why, I would have recognized you anywhere,” Gretta smiled. Michael is right -​
​an Englehart wears their family crest on their face,” and the three women laughed.​
​“We came to help you get settled in.  I know it is not what you are used to and last​
​night had to be difficult and somewhat confusing, but we have all had to adjust to​
​the times,” Gretta sighed.  “I also brought you some bergamot tea, Helena smiled.​
​It’s our way of saying prayers for our county and the czar and his family and it​
​reminds us of better days. And, it’s our way of welcoming you.”​
​Gretta was tall and very striking-looking with thin lips and a long dark brown mane​
​of wavy hair. Lillya was surprised how little gray she for had for a woman of her​
​age.  Helena was much plainer, but pretty in her own way. Lillya’s eyes lit up the​

​93​
​morning sky, which was beginning to change its mood from blue-gray to a crisp​
​golden orange. Gretta pulled out some delicious-looking morning biscuits. Lillya​
​caught the scent of fresh baked grains and the smell of cinnamon.​
​“You know, I met you as a child. I was younger than you are now. Michael, my​
​Michael, had quite a crush on your mother. He thought the world of her. Yuri, your​
​father, took it in stride. I think he was used to it. “Oh, I’m sorry. I’m speaking to​
​you a single woman forgetting that the mother is always the mother. Your mother​
​was quite confusing. No one felt they could compete with her in any way. My​
​husband made a fool of himself sometimes.”​
​“This is going to be a happy reunion,” Gretta jumped in.​
​Lillya smiled, wondering, though, how Michael’s wife really felt about taking such​
​risks with their lives and and Lillya began to think about all the secrets her father​
​had obviously kept. What secrets would his journal reveal about them all?  This​
​woman who was Michael’s wife, a cousin by marriage, whose name was Margretta​
​Villanova until she became an Englehardt. Could she be the key? What she did not​
​know?​
​“Let me boil some water for us to steep the wonderful black tea you brought us.”​
​Gretta pronounced.​
​“My husband and Michael should be here soon.” Helena broke in.​
​“And Anton is anxious to meet you both.” Lillya added.​

​94​
​Margretta’s nickname was Gretta. Older than Lillya, she still had maintained a​
​good sense of humor and zest for life and love even though she, like Lillya, had​
​lost much of what she’d thought would be hers. Lillya could see that these women​
​might become new friends. Oh, how happy Lillya was to hear voices other than her​
​own and Anton’s. She loved her husband dearly, but she was in need of other​
​companions and the sound of stories, laughter that only other people could bring​
​with them and in return they could retell interesting stories and events their circus​
​employees and entertainers had shared with them. Surely, they had enough​
​interesting stories from the circus to last most people two lifetimes. Unfortunately,​
​with strangers, that’s what they would have to share, but who knew what the future​
​will bring? Both she and Anton needed to hear the sound of opinions even if it only​
​gave to them the source of conversation and debate between the two of them later,​
​when they would find themselves alone at night.​
​Tonight, they would gather in conversation.  Perhaps one day soon they would​
​even help her in their search for Natasha.​
​By the time Nicolai and Anton returned to the house, the women were chattering​
​away. Anton, so happy that his wife was engaging animatedly in conversation,​
​handed her a small bouquet of wildflowers he had picked along their way back.​

​95​
​The women were talking about a celebration they wanted to have that evening. “I​
​thought you might like these, my dear,” he said as he handed them to Lillya.​
​Anton and Nikolai began to store the goods they had collected and the women​
​slowly began turning the carriage house into a home.​
​Michael walked through the door, the main attraction as far as Lillya was​
​concerned. Lillya found him surprisingly jubilant especially considering their​
​situation. Not an ounce of fear showed on his face. Not a clue that he could be​
​involved in a scheme of hiding aristocrats.​
​“Lillya,” he smiled, as if it had only been months since they last saw each other​
​“it’s been too long and how is that father of yours? He was always my favorite​
​relative. But then again, he was the one who won the heart of Angelica. Quite a​
​feat. She truly was an angel on earth! Born to do things we couldn’t even​
​understand.” Lillya tried to take it all in without showing her feelings. She gave​
​him a brief, sad, recent history of her father and tried not to tear up too much.​
​“I like to think that he’s still at home, walking his horse, carrying a bottle of his​
​favorite wine at his side, there with Stephano his houseman to keep him company​
​and to listen to his stories at hand. But truthfully, I don’t know if he is alive or​
​dead.  And Lillya welled up as if she were a ten-year-old girl and it greatly​
​embarrassed her. “I believe the creaky sound of the old wooden floors in our house​

​96​
​must be helping to keep him company. And he’s very good at having conversations​
​with himself.”​
​“But today is a joyous occasion. We must be grateful for these moments we have,”​
​Michael said in deep reflection. “No one knows how many more we have left or​
​what tomorrow will bring,” he said thinking of all of the friends he had lost, while​
​remembering the reasons he should to remain in a grateful frame of mind.​
​“You are right cousin, I Lillya promise not to be so solemn at dinner tonight.” And​
​with that Lillya gave him her best Engelhardt smile.​
​***​
​“The parish priest, Nikolai, is a generous soul, and he has been paid well to​
​maintain it. However, no one is truly safe. That said I think you should be​
​comfortable, certainly much safer than if you had stayed with your father.” Lillya​
​got pangs in her belly at the mention of her father. I hope you’ll send my regards to​
​him when the opportunity allows.  He is a good man who has had to rise above​
​much sadness, your mother, but you and I will have plenty of time to talk about​
​that another time. It upsets Gretta and right now you want her on your side.” Lillya​
​didn’t quite understand what her cousin meant. She took a deep breath.​
​“Nikolai and I have established a very loyal congregation and he has told them that​
​his uncle was coming to stay for a while, so people will welcome you with open​
​arms and not apprehension, gossip or mystery.”​

​97​
​Lillya opened the windows to get some air inside the house and to blow away some​
​of the intrigue and mystery. A nice swift breeze came through and sprinkled the​
​scent of Kungar leather, that had slipped in through the cracks.​
​“It’s been a long hard journey” Lillya finally said, I look forward to hearing stories​
​about my mother. I was very young when she passed away. For now, though, I​
​believe I need a nap.”​
​Michael kissed her on both cheeks as did the priest’s wife and Gretta. He and​
​Anton hugged a deeper hug than normal for they knew within this gesture they had​
​made a promise to take care of one another’s family. A gesture from where there​
​was no turning back. If one got caught aiding and abetting the enemy the other one​
​did, too.​
​Lillya wanted to feel worthy of the favor her father had asked. She felt quite sure​
​that her father had already fulfilled his end of the request many years prior for, he​
​was not one to ask others for help. Except his houseman Stephano to whom he had​
​been paying a lofty monthly sum and more.​
​What is the secret they are both keeping? Lillya wondered about her father and​
​Michael.​
​“He must have something on her cousin. But what? She closed her eyes and  tossed​
​and turned her way to sleep.****​

​98​
​New Chapter​
​Herv​é​​Laurent Fleury was a plain sort of fellow that​​had worked all his life to make​
​himself big. If he was given a lesson that would normally take two hours, he would​
​take four to six hours of study to make certain when called upon that his answer​
​would be perfect.  His dress was always impeccable, and he studied the dictionary​
​so in conversation he could throw out a word or two to display his intelligence and​
​aptitude.​
​Laurent, as most people called him, also loved horses and he worked just as hard to​
​become a master at that as he did with everything else. When he wasn’t studying to​
​perfect his person or appearance, he was at the chateau of a captain at the Cadre​
​Noir who had discovered this overachiever of a boy in an orphanage nearby and​
​decided he would be a very good worker.​

​99​
​There was never a son and fatherly relationship among the two, but a deep respect​
​of each one’s skill when it came to horses, and so the man kept Laurent on and​
​clothed him and fed him and one day suddenly surprised him with a scholarship to​
​the famed academy.​
​Laurent took this opportunity like he took everything else; seriously, and thus he​
​rose in the ranks until it was clear that some day he would equal his patron savior.​
​However, one day while training the horses, his patron savior had a heart attack​
​and died, leaving Laurent nothing but himself and his position at the academy, for​
​which he was grateful. Laurent showed a very bright future ahead of him. The only​
​thing missing was love and a wife. Then one day, while riding in the woods near​
​the creek, he saw a streak of lightning ride past him.  Not certain what it was​
​hereturned to the exact same spot the following day in case the mystery decided to​
​repeat itself. Being the kind of person who left little up to chance, he observed his​
​surroundings like any good soldier would. He noted to his left stood a large tree​
​that had been damaged in a recent storm and behind it a patch of beautiful wild​
​roses that had found a home amongst the dandelions and brush. But the greatest​
​impression of all was the scent of the flowers that lingered in the air and the sound​
​of the water rushing behind him.​
​The next morning when he returned, a beautiful girl with shiney golden hair and​
​emerald eyes, dressed in bright red silks was standing upright on her horse’s back​

​100​
​and she flew past him like a flaming arrow with a gigantic smile on her face​
​carefree and happy. She blew him a kiss. Laurent almost fell off his horse!​
​“She’s the most wondrous creature I’ve ever seen,” he moaned over and over to​
​himself. “I must meet her,” he exclaimed!​
​Having to work overtime, which for years had been no problem for him, that​
​weekend Laurent sadly went to do his duty and fulfill his obligation at the​
​academy. He had been given the job of showing yet another wealthy man around​
​the academy. “Don’t they see enough horses?” Laurent sighed to himself out of​
​fear that if he didn’t return to that exact spot this morning the girl would think that​
​he wasn’t interested, which could not have been further from the truth. Still, he​
​took pride in his work and appearance for by now it was who he had become. But​
​when the wealthy man arrived, a man from the academy approached Laurent to let​
​him know that the man had brought his daughter. “He says she is very interested in​
​riding, so you might need to slow your pace and cater it a bit toward her as I​
​believe that is what would make this man happy.”​
​Just at that moment, a swirling girl dressed in yellow, gold, and red entered the​
​stable with her father.​

​101​
​“This is Yuri _______ and his daughter Lillya.” The squint in Laurent’s eye​
​examining if what he was seeing was the truth could have told one hundred tales.​
​Every fantasy he had ever had seemed to come real when he saw this girl.​
​Laurent took several breaths, then escorted Yuri and Lillya into the manage where​
​stood some of the most beautiful horses Lillya had ever seen. Although the cadet​
​was very distinguished-looking, he seemed a bit tongue-tied at first until he began​
​to display the very French upper crust form of horse ballet of which he was a​
​master.​
​Lillya’s father whispered to her, telling her that very few horsemen around the​
​world knew this special art as well as this cadet did.​
​Laurent knew that this was his time to shine. The girl certainly would be captivated​
​and would have difficulty keeping her eyes on anyone or anything else other than​
​him.  “Thank you, father,” Lillya whispered back to Yuri. “Coming here has been​
​worth it if only for this.”​
​Yuri, feeling quite pleased with himself, asked the cadet if he would like to come​
​over to the Chateau where they were staying and go riding with he and his​
​daughter sometime soon.​
​Laurent could not believe how lucky he was to have been the one chosen to give​
​Yuri and Lillya the tour, and he quickly obliged. The rest of the day, Laurent could​
​do nothing but brag, which was not his usual custom. “Did you see that girl?” he​

​102​
​asked every cadet he could talk to.  “She’s going to be my wife,” he repeated over​
​and over.​
​Lillya, when she got back to the Chateau, immediately ran to the stables of their​
​neighbor and took out Whisper the horse she had been given to use during their​
​stay​
​“You are going to learn some special tricks this summer,” she smiled.  For the rest​
​of the afternoon until almost sunset Lillya schooled the horse until Yuri made her​
​come back inside. “I’m going to see Laurent tomorrow, and you can’t say no,​
​Papa.” And he knew she was right. “He’s going to teach me this secret art of horse​
​ballet that very few men know.  Just think what the aristocratic women will do​
​when I show them this!” Yuri didn’t want to think about it because his daughter​
​was a force to be reckoned with when she made up her mind.​
​Lillya could barely contain her excitement.  She had heard of the fine art of​
​dressage and had actually seen one master once with her father when he took her​
​with him to pick out a stallion.  There was a French man with a beautiful​
​--------------horse the color of chestnut stallion who had been taught this almost​
​sacred art. Lillya knew how privileged she was to have been able to tag along with​
​her father and she knew better than to pester him or his invitation would vanish as​
​quickly as it had appeared.  “You will look, listen, and observe and be quiet,” her​
​father said, “and nothing more. Are you able to do that?​

​103​
​For days before, she practiced the art of silence, the most important and difficult​
​one for her. So, when Laurent came along four years later and she was four years​
​older, Lillya felt that she was more than ready to be schooled by him and by this​
​time she had become a masterful rider herself.​
​“Don’t get too serious with this Laurent,” her father said after several days.  And​
​then he reminded her that she was in France to perfect her French and to get to​
​know lots of French girls and boys, not just one.  “Don’t worry, Papa. He doesn’t​
​think of me that way. Besides he’s very polite and has never tried to force himself​
​on me.” But Yuri knew men and he knew that they didn’t always say what they​
​truly thought.​
​“You know that I’ve gone to all the dances I’ve been invited to, and when I get​
​home I’m going to set my intentions on Anton Vronsky. He’s the person I want to​
​marry!” Lillya liked to get her father all riled up. But it was true for Lillya. Ever​
​since meeting Anton, she could think of no future better or brighter than being in a​
​circus, and she had never met a boy more exotic or kind.  “No, father, no worries​
​about me staying in France and marrying Laurent. That would put me a sea and an​
​ocean away from you and the man I will one day love. I couldn’t bear being away​
​from the two of you, let alone Natasha!  I like him very well, but he’s not the one​
​for me, you’ll see.” And she said goodnight, thinking about Anton while counting​
​her horse’s steps, because if she could she wanted to do this art as perfect as him.​

​104​
​Since coming to France, Lillya had gotten into the habit of borrowing Whisper,​
​their neighbor’s stallion every morning. She also got into the habit of seeing​
​Laurent daily. She was surprised to discover in herself that there was something​
​about the French that made her feel free and all warm inside and it wasn’t just​
​because she was living in the middle of a vineyard or that her father let her sip​
​wine at meals as she watched the others drink by the carafe. Lillya felt French​
​passion seemed to be a happier passion than the daunting sadness described in​
​most Russian stories, paintings, music, dance and poems. It made her want to be​
​more free, and sometimes with Laurent she found herself becoming someone else,​
​a girl less shy and more expressive than the girl she had been all of her life.  Yes,​
​she still rode like lightning and could light up the nighttime sky, and there were​
​many from the opposite sex both old and young taken by her, but she had held​
​herself back. When she was with Laurent she could see in his eyes that he was​
​falling deeply in love with her without telling her or expressing any words. Lillya​
​began to frighten herself, for in this foreign world she was beginning to feel this​
​way too. Then one evening, as he helped her off her horse, his hands got tangled in​

​105​
​the garlands in her hair and as he gently pulled them out, he found his hands lightly​
​touching her face and surprising not only her, he leaned in and kissed her. Then he​
​pulled back and looked into her eyes and could see that she liked it and wanting her​
​so badly he did it again, only this time for twice as long. “Will you be mine?” he​
​asked her. “We can spend our lives riding through the breeze and dancing on the​
​shore. I promise you will be happy for it is all that I want in this world.”  Lillya​
​was shocked and excited at the same time.  No man had ever spoken to her like a​
​grown woman before. So enamored by the moment was she, she sighed, “Yes, my​
​love, yes, yes!” But by the time the second “Yes,” slipped off her tongue, Lillya​
​could already feel the gravity of her actions and yet she was conflicted by how​
​tingly she felt inside. And Laurent, hearing her breathe and putting his hand on her​
​chest to make certain that the pounding heartbeat was hers, went from a knight to​
​becoming a king, for the young woman he just kissed could be nothing less than a​
​queen.​
​When they left to part their separate ways home he kissed her again; just long​
​enough and hard enough to make her question herself and she left him dizzy and​
​confused.​
​When she returned to the Chateau, her handmaid could tell something was wrong​
​just in the way Lillya was avoiding her father. She immediately asked for a bath,​
​almost demanded it, as if she wanted to wipe something off of her. The handmaid,​

​106​
​trying to be nice to Lillya, instead made her cry. “Pourquoi pleurez-vous?​
​Dites-moi,” she asked. And she spilled her story of her infatuation with Anton and​
​her embarrassment of getting carried away with Laurent. “How will I ever be able​
​to explain this to the man I believe to be my true love? He pulled out this blue​
​velvet box before I left, and he slipped it into my own pocket. I didn’t know what​
​to do. It all happened so fast.” And Lillya began to cry even more. “I’m afraid to​
​open it by myself.  Will you stay here while I do?” and her handmaid nodded a​
​simple syes reply with her head.​
​Unbeknownst to them both, Yuri had followed Lillya in, and when he could hear​
​that she was upset, he stayed outside her door and listened to her as she cried her​
​heart out. Wishing he could wrap his arms around her like he did when she was a​
​little girl. Instead he did the only thing he felt a good father could do. He walked​
​next door, apologized for pulling Sergei from his dinner and they went into the​
​library where they could have some privacy. And they talked father to father.​
​Yuri said not a word to Lillya and better than that he asked no questions. Yuri did​
​what he felt he should do to not throw dirt on either the young man or his young​
​daughter. But as the morning sun began to peep its head through the panes in​
​Lillya’s bedroom, a groggy headed young woman was put into a carriage with big​
​feather pillows where she was served breakfast dumplings as her father said his​

​107​
​goodbyes to Sergei and they pulled away as suddenly as they had arrived. Soon​
​they would be in Paris and on a train to St. Petersburg as if they had never gone.​
​Lillya never saw Laurent again, but he saw her. However, she remembered the​
​many mornings and teachings he had so freely given. She pictured herself on top of​
​Sergei’s horse Whisper and in her head went over the ballet step by step that​
​Laurent had taught her until it became a part of her, because even in her present​
​state of mind, she was not so far gone that she was unable to see, its value to her in​
​the world.​
​On the long trip home when she was certain she was all alone she opened the box​
​that Laurent had so gently placed in her pocket. Inside was a short note that read​
​“To Lillya, the flame of my life. You sparkle brighter than any emerald or ruby.​
​May this always be yours and you be mine.”​
​Years later, Lillya passed the brooch to her good friend Katya, a beautiful ballet​
​dancer, as she felt it was better to have it out of her hands. Katya, in turn, gave it to​
​her daughter Donatalia, a very talented young ballerina who Lillya could still​
​imagine when she shut her eyes the way Donatalia looked in her light lavender​
​gown*** (make certain the dress  color doesn’t conflict with book one) the night​
​she  danced with Lillya and Anton’s son, son Vladimir on the lawn at the Winter​
​Palace for the Czarina Catherine )?). Donatalia’s father was so proud and happy.​
​The only true sadness was that Katya had passed away and was not able to join in​

​108​
​the celebration. Lillya could understand how Donatalia felt for at occasions like​
​this she still missed her mother, too. Still, Lillya was certain they were there sith​
​them, giving Donatalia the ability to fly each time Vladimir lifted her in the air as​
​if she were only a feather.​

​Lillya and Anton were welcomed by the congregation inKungar in a friendly, quiet​
​sort of way. No one wanted to get too close or ask too many questions. Everyone​
​held the same belief that the less they knew the better off they would be. There​
​were limits they all had silently agreed upon and it was those limits that kept them​

​109​
​safe. Less knowledge was the key to safety.  And Lillya didn’t mind, she actually​
​appreciated having a little peace.​
​Anton, on the other hand, needed to keep himself busy, so he spent most of his​
​days helping Nikolai do construction work for those unable to mend their houses​
​themselves. Michael did not join them, instead he used age and money to get him​
​out of the work he still felt he was above, but he donated to the cause by buying​
​many of the supplies they needed and overseeing the finances of the church. On​
​random afternoons, though, he would come and spend time with Lillya. “Your​
​mother had what they called a third eye. Did you know that? She could see inside​
​other people by focusing on it, or at least that is what she told us and it made our​
​afternoons and evenings more entertaining. It could have just been a perfectly​
​placed mole on her forehead, but your mother enjoyed being exotic, so we all​
​believed it because then it made us knowing her more exotic, too. Your mother’s​
​family had an Indian woman as a caretaker and your mother loved to get lost in the​
​many imaginative stories she shared. When she was eight, her parents took her to​
​Thailand. She must have told you this story. All she could talk about when she​
​returned home was how she rode an elephant whose name was Namaste.”​
​“Yes, I do remember that story, for when I was six she gave me a painting of an​
​elephant she said looked just like the one that she had met. She swore it could have​

​110​
​been Namerse’s twin. She added a third eye to the painting of this elephant she​
​gave to me so that he could watch over when my mother was no longer at home.”​
​For a moment Lillya drifted some place far, far away in the past, but then she​
​remembered her father’s journal and the mystery she was trying to solve, and knew​
​she had work to do and she came back to life.​
​Lillya understood, for she was targeted in a similar yet different way. Lillya had a​
​mole on her back shaped like a heart and that always marked her as different. And​
​set her apart.​
​They had been in Kungar for about three to four weeks. Lillya was losing track.​
​Now that they were in one spot, Anton quit making the marks on his stick to keep​
​track of the days, and they were settling in. The three couples spent most of their​
​time together and liked to joke about that first awkward evening together, their​
​celebration, and getting to know one another.​
​They recalled the table on which they dined had vases full of wildflowers, each​
​vase more colorful than the one before it. Anton had made certain to pick only​
​flowers that he thought would please his wife. Michael brought with him their very​
​best bottle of wine and a bottle of vodka he had been saving that had once lived in​
​the cellar of the Czar Nicholas. Michael liked to think that its scent could make its​
​way across the Ural Mountain range as the Czar sat down to dinner with his wife​

​111​
​and children. The thought of this, even for a fleeting moment, gave him hope that​
​the world he had known still had some life. In soft tones they toasted the czar and​
​his family to be certain the neighbors or anyone passing by could not hear them.​
​He hoped would at least get a whiff of its scent and somehow find its way across​
​the Ural Mountain range, where he and his family had been taken as prisoners.​
​Michael liked to think that when he opened the bottle and toasted the Czar and his​
​family, that somehow the Czar and his children would feel less alone. But​
​everything had to have a sense of discretion, for fear of the unknown and what​
​their neighbors really thought and believed. Gretta brought a casserole with​
​potatoes and carrots and chunks of good beef. Nikolai’s wife made special cookies​
​that were sweetened with honey and cinnamon and a hint of cardamom. Best of all,​
​they brought to the party their true selves, which they felt safe to display, even if it​
​wasn’t wise to do so, they needed to let go of their fear. The alcohol and the sweets​
​had created a dreamlike quality, one that she hadn’t experienced since leaving her​
​father. They had had to wear worry as if it were an overcoat. She started to relax​
​and said a silent prayer, recognizing how much better they were from the majority​
​of people, for there were many, many who were suffering.​
​Nikolai and his wife did their best to be good hosts. It was hard to be discreet. This​
​was a reunion, a special occasion. There had been so much planning and​
​preparation for Anton and Lillya’s arrival that it was hard not to be giddy and full​

​112​
​of laughter. A familiarity swept through the air. You would never have believed​
​that they were just getting to know one another or get reacquainted. If you had​
​passed by the carriage house that night you would have thought they were exactly​
​who they were portraying to be, old friends and relatives.​
​Michael pulled out his bottle of wine. Lillya almost felt at home when she saw the​
​label. Her father had that exact same bottle. She wondered if Michael knew it and​
​was silently making a toast to him and St. Petersburg. Just for that act alone if the​
​wrong person had seen it, it could probably have meant imprisonment. But instead​
​of drinking the wine in hand-cut crystal glasses, they drank it in mugs that were​
​used for cheap beer, then Michael quickly hid the empty bottle and pulled out an​
​empty bottle of beer that could be lying on the table should someone unexpected​
​appear. The more they drank, savoring these delicate tastes, the happier the clan​
​became. For no one knew from one minute to the next what their life would be like​
​so they had to learn to appreciate every good moment that came, and not take​
​anything for granted.​
​***​
​Michael’s workshed, and the parish’s, too, kept more than shovels and​
​gardening tools. Sometimes Gretta would ask him what he was doing out there,​
​and he would answer, “Just thinking of you, my dear.”​

​113​
​Each spring, Michael planted a special flower to represent the qualities he​
​found endearing and beautiful in his wife. How bright and shiny they made​
​everything else appear around them. He had grown sunflowers that summer​
​because of their beauty and openness, and how they seemed to always welcome​
​anyone who looked at them.  He knew that bringing Lillya and Anton to Kungar​
​would ultimately be hard on his wife, but he owed this to Yuri. He was repaying an​
​old debt, one long overdue because their presence, unbeknownst to the others,​
​brought much more than anyone knew, and Gretta was going to need to find a way​
​to be welcoming and generous even though one would cause her pain without her​
​knowing this.​
​***​
​When Lillya woke up the next morning after their grand welcoming celebration,​
​thoughts of Perm and Natasha were floating in her head. She knew that for now it​
​was best to keep those thoughts to herself. These people whom she barely knew​
​were taking big risks in trying to keep her and her husband out of grave danger She​
​couldn’t make any decisions without thinking of their welfare first. However, when​
​she closed her eyes later that first afternoon, the voices of famous opera singers​
​each reaching out with their mouths wide open, their tongues relaxed, were singing​
​their favorite arias in the direction of the city of Perm where the relatively new​

​114​
​Opera House in Perm lived. The trajectory of their voices seemed to rise over the​
​sunflowers opening up the sunflowers smile. Lillya smiled back at them. They​
​gave her a route in which to escape for several hours each day and music always​
​brought her joy.​
​Lillya did everything she could to keep her business at home and not to go out in​
​search of anyone.  She worked at making the cottage house comfortable, and the​
​flowers Anton brought her each day helped.  She only hoped he wasn’t taking them​
​from other people’s gardens. She understood how important a particular flower​
​might mean to someone. Lillya was dying for a fast stallion to ride. One that she​
​would hoot and holler from and could be free. She let Anton represent them. After​
​all, Anton had spent a lifetime entertaining people and he was highly qualified.​
​But both Lillya and Anton kept their circus skills to themselves to help protect their​
​identities, not wanting to jar any memories, for lots of people went to the circus​
​yearly and they knew Anton and Lillya’s history.​
​Gretta stopped by most mornings with a special treat, and Lillya would unwrap the​
​treat while Gretta watched her. She loved the way Lillya wore happiness on her​
​face.​
​Gretta was finding it hard to dislike Lillya. They both loved music, and Gretta​
​often came in the morning with her fiddle in hand. They would sing old Russian​

​115​
​folk songs such as _______ to each other. And sometimes they discovered the​
​harmonies in a song and that always brought them closer together, like it or not.​
​About once a week they would create competitions just to keep their brains active​
​and to challenge the other. It was a good game for both of them. One game they​
​often played with the six of them. Nikolai’s wife Helena usually could outpace all​
​of them.​
​They put all the letters in the alphabet into a bowl and each person would pull one​
​out and their partner would be their secretary as they proceeded to name every​
​song they could think of whose title began with that letter. That was part one of the​
​game and whoever won that segment got to be the first couple to choose which​
​couple’s songs they would sing the first verse of and whoever got the most points​
​got a bottle of Michael’s finest vodka and if Michael and Gretta won, they would​
​be owed a present from either Lillya or Helena that they had hand-stitched, such as​
​a pretty wall hanging, initials on their socks, etc.  There were always good presents​
​to be had.​
​Lillya found Helena to be reliable and Gretta good entertainment and​
​well-cultured. By the time Gretta and Helena left for the day, Lillya knew she had​
​about thirty minutes if she hurried to peek into her father’s old journal, for soon​
​Anton would be home. The one thing she valued during these days in Kungar was​
​yes, the company of these two women. She had been able to lay her worry out on​

​116​
​the table and bake it into a pie or a cake and make something sweet out of​
​something sour and distasteful.​
​“Anjelica was not always the angel she appeared to be,” her father wrote, “but at​
​the time we met she was everything I wanted. She loved horses and animals and it​
​was clear she had the ability to tuck away her wilder side for the people and things​
​she found to be important. I never dreamed she would get so sick, but how she​
​loved our Lillya more than herself. Her world revolved around that child.” Lillya​
​didn’t look in her father’s journal in any sort of chronological order.  Some days​
​she read a portion about his past and other days she read a portion that he wrote​
​while it was happening in the present tense.​
​One day after Gretta and Helena left, she pulled up something quite unexpected.​
​“Still there is something I need to share with her. We don’t like to keep secrets​
​from one another and I have a big one I am holding from her about my cousin​
​Michael.”​
​Lillya just about dropped the journal. Wanting to do nothing other than read this​
​book, she was quite disappointed when she heard the sound of Nikolai’s wife​
​getting closer.​
​Nikolai’s wife had been very kind and did everything she could to endear herself to​
​Lillya and bait her into telling stories of the past. Lillya, wanting friendship and a​
​conversation, became easy prey. She even told Helena about a boy she met in​

​117​
​France when she was a girl and how he taught her the art of dressage and how that​
​simple act of teacher and student changed her life, and that of the circus’, too.​
​Lila could hear Helena’s footsteps getting closer. Lillya knew she had to tuck the​
​journal away for now and hope it didn’t get found between now and the next time​
​she would have a chance to look at it. She found it interesting that the parish priest​
​and his wife had put so much of their lives at stake for complete strangers. She was​
​grateful, but still found it worrisome. “Don’t priests do good deeds?” she asked​
​herself, trying to figure out each person’s motives. But as she read more of her​
​father’s journal, she began to realize that Michael didn’t just like her mother, she​
​was beginning to think he loved her mother and had hoped it would be himself​
​who married her. Lillya was beginning to believe that love was moving Michael​
​forward, and after a while she understood the confusion that Gretta felt as she put it​
​all together, too.​
​“What motivated Helena, or did she just get pulled into this like an object in a​
​storm that gets blown away and then has to make where they land their new​
​home?”​
​Lillya quickly stuffed the journal in her bag. She wondered, too. She understood​
​Michael wanting to help his cousin and his cousin’s daughter, but she wasn’t quite​

​118​
​so certain of what drove Helena; wasn’t so certain of her motives, and she felt​
​horrible for having those thoughts about someone who’d been so good to her and​
​was probably saving her life. Luckily that day, Helena had just come to drop off a​
​shawl she had finished knitting. “I made this for you, Lillya. I found the perfect​
​emerald green threads and yarn to put together something I think is perfect for you.​
​It will keep you warm on chilly evenings and if it’s too heavy to carry when you​
​depart, you can just leave it here and we’ll get it to you another time, in better​
​times I hope. Perhaps I’ll be able to see that wonderful estate Michael has talked​
​about so often and ride one of your stallions.”​
​Lillya was taken aback by the shawl’s beauty. Some of her favorite colors:​
​teal, blood orange and yellow gold. Helena asked Lillya if she would want to go to​
​the river with her. “I find it calming, and I am able to daydream and imagine what​
​it was like for us before all of this craziness. We don't have to stay long, just long​
​enough to feel good and the river run through our bodies.” And they both laughed.​
​“Do you think that will happen before I die?” laughed Lillya.  She hadn’t​
​wandered too far away since they arrived. All those days of walking miles and her​
​feet and legs were sore from all the effort she had put out. But without Anton​
​looking out for her, she was not confident in Helena’s ability to provide safety, so​
​she made up an excuse; that she was writing a journal of her escapades. “One day I​

​119​
​will share these stories with you and maybe the world.” She smiled.  “Maybe​
​another day. I love the water and how calm and free it makes me feel.”​
​Helena left, but not before leaving a watermelon and a few pears behind, all​
​prized gifts in Kungar. Lillya looked at the clock. She saw she had just a little more​
​time to write and wanted to put it to good use, so back to her father’s journal she​
​went and this time she turned to a page at will. Surprisingly Michael’s name was​
​right at the top:​
​“Michael might be getting himself into trouble.”​
​.****Chapter Change​

​120​
​Lillya saw the rest of France mostly when looking out the window of the train. Her​
​father had gathered her so quickly, she had no time to put her thoughts together.​
​He had already made the decisions for her. All Lillya wanted was to be in the​
​loving arms of her best friend, but she didn’t know if she could face her. She had​
​made so many mistakes, she believed.​
​“What must Laurent think? I never meant to hurt him this way. How will I explain​
​this to Anton when I get home, or get the words out to tell Natasha the truth?”​
​Lillya lay in solitude on the long, expensive journey back to St. Petersburg.  She​
​didn’t know what to say and she wasn’t interested in much of anything, even the​
​wonderful food laid in front of her, not even her favorite desserts. Her father tried​
​to bait her with profiteroles and Poire Belle​​Hélène​,​​but even that was useless. He​
​couldn’t get that saddened look off her face. She carried a book with her​
​everywhere and used it as a prop when she sat down so others would think she was​
​occupied and unavailable for conversation. All day and night long she stared at the​
​clouds or the passing landscapes absorbing nothing but her thoughts and her days​
​in the Loire Valley and Laurent.​
​Yuri was disappointed that the trip of a lifetime he had planned for his daughter fell​
​so flat. A steamship from St. Petersburg to Bordeaux and then on the way back, a​
​first-class train with four days in Paris; museums and dining, the​
​Champs-​É​lysees... Four days in Paris had turned into​​one.  He had never seen his​

​121​
​daughter so upset. His daughter was mixed-up and confused and Yuri blamed​
​himself for not watching over her more carefully and getting too caught up in his​
​own world. Lillya cried off and on the entire way to St. Petersburg and upon her​
​return accepted no visitors, not even Natasha.  She asked another handmaid to​
​draw her baths, one that she knew would never have the nerve to ask her questions​
​about herself.​
​Then one day when they had been home for one week, Lillya called no one and​
​went into her closet and dressed herself. She then went to the stables alone and​
​picked out the horse she thought would be best. She groomed and primped the​
​handsome stallion, was very meticulous with her actions and whispered to him the​
​entire time. Soon the horse was rubbing his nose against her chest and making​
​happy whinnying sounds. She did this three mornings in a row and by the end of​
​the third day it was if Lillya and the stallion had become forged as one. Everyone​
​was interested but no one interfered with her ritual they just waited; her father,​
​Natasha, the stable boys all curious to see where it would go, what Lillya had in​
​mind. “At least she’s doing something,” her father said to Natasha. Natasha,​
​somewhat hurt by Lillya’s actions, felt as if she had been pushed aside, angry and​
​upset by Lillya’s selfishness, Natasha gave no answer to Yuri’s comment. She just​
​nodded.​

​122​
​Each morning, they waited to see what she would do next. On the fourth morning,​
​she saddled the stallion her father called Bruno, the one she felt could listen and​
​understand her wishes. By now they were bonded, and he was sensitive to her​
​voice and movement. She grabbed his reins, jumped on the horse and asked the​
​stable boy to open the gate. She gave the horse a swift kick and off they went.​
​Lillya told the horse all that she had to say. She rode him hard and fast and soft and​
​gentle pouring out not only what was on her mind, but where she expected to go​
​and what she hoped they would accomplish together. And when they returned to​
​the stables, she brought the stallion back out to the ring and she walked with him,​
​letting him cool down as she continued talking to him in a low, calm voice. Later,​
​she told Natasha that she was just explaining to him what they were going to do​
​and what would be expected of him.​
​Natasha didn’t want to imagine what could have occurred to have put Lillya in this​
​state, but in this particular moment she seemed cool and at home with herself.​
​Lillya knew what she was meant to do.​
​“Something must have gone very wrong on their trip, but what?” Natasha​
​wondered, later that same day, but truly she already knew. “It had to be a man.”​

​123​
​Her father Yuri told everyone to leave her alone.  “She’s fine. She’s just in an​
​inward state of mind making major life decisions. Everyone deserves that, don’t​
​you think? Let her be.” And they all did.​
​Two weeks later, Lillya called to her father from outside the stable and asked him​
​to join her.  “Papa! I want to show you something!” Surprised by now to hear her​
​voice asking for his attention, this caught him a little off guard. As he walked​
​toward his daughter, he thought about how she had spent weeks hidden away in her​
​room and at one point had gone to the extreme of having her food left by her door.​
​She even drew her own bath and dried her own self off.​
​“I’m coming,”Yuri replied. Suddenly, as Yuri got closer to the rink, a bell went off​
​and things began to make sense.  Intuitively, he knew what his daughter had been​
​doing. Moments later he saw it with his own two eyes, and what had started out as​
​a small grin turned into a gigantic smile on his face. His daughter was sitting on​
​top of Bruno, slowly going through the horse ballet exercises that Laurent had​
​taught her. He started to clap and gave her daughter a standing ovation that he​
​realized she would have to get used to. “My daughter is probably the only young​
​woman in all of Russia who knows the secret art of dressage.” Yuri hugged his​
​daughter. That comment Lillya had made in France circled the thoughts that were​
​now chirping in his head, “Can you imagine what the aristocratic ladies of St.​

​124​
​Petersburg will do with this?” Lillya had said. And for the first time in maybe a​
​month, he saw his daughter happy and content.​
​Lillya suddenly he had an appetite. “I’m starving!” She smiled. “Let’s go eat some​
​breakfast.” She broke out in a huge Englehardt grin that practically took over her​
​entire face and it reminded Yuri of his love and duty for his daughter.​
​“That was an amazing trip that I will never forget,” she told her father. “Do you​
​think Natasha could draw me a bath?”​
​***​
​All of the aristocrats left the comfort of their palaces, wanting to get a glance​
​of this daring young rider who had somehow been schooled in an art they were all​
​dying to learn.  The men didn’t know what to do because no respectable man​
​would ask a woman about anything important, especially about horses and riding.​
​Of course, they had always considered themselves best, but there was no denying​
​this girl was special and she had something they wanted. So the men begged their​
​wives in private to pursue lessons from Lillya in riding. They wanted their wives to​
​get close to her, for Lillya was becoming a sensation. When the Czarina invited her​
​over to sip lemonade and play cards with her, it became It would be the beginning​
​of Lillya’s own coronation.​

​125​
​It had all been done discreetly so the men could save face, but Yuri could see how​
​differently aristocratic St. Petersburg reacted to his daughter. Even though they had​
​been previously well-regarded, they were now a part of an inner circle that before​
​this they could never have dreamed to be in.  Lillya could do what she wanted, and​
​she did, by way of seeing Anton, who was not of her class, but Anton could not be​
​put in a class, for he was different from anyone else, and the acceptance of that​
​relationship from inside the Palace walls afforded them the opportunity and gave​
​them permission to love.​
​In the beginning, Anton believed he would no longer have a chance to be the​
​one to court Lillya. He didn’t believe that luck would be on his side this time​
​around, but he was smitten and wasn’t going to give up. Petra, Anton’s mother,​
​could read Lillya’s interest in circus life, and encouraged her son to stay steady, as​
​steady as he was walking the wire. “She’ll come around, Anton, just give her time.​
​It’s you she wants to be with. There’s no one else.”​
​The aristocrats, wanting to see Lillya and learn what they could, while​
​keeping their husbands happy and proud, because by now the husbands had learned​
​the art from their wives, and the circus was no longer below their status. Even the​
​Czarina had given her nod of approval.  And so the aristocrats followed her to the​
​circus and they stayed for the entire show. Anton and his family, who were already​

​126​
​famous, became more famous, while Lillya became an international sensation, and​
​when he got down on one knee and proposed, the whole world was waiting to​
​receive them, and the presence felt like shooting stars.​
​But as her luck grew, bitterness in another began to take hold, for all that he had​
​dreamed and thought would come true had gone to someone else. His heart and his​
​soul would never be the same. And as his bitterness grew and festered, it could not​
​be moved or changed.​

​NEW CHAPTER​
​Michael has met someone; a woman I should say, and he can’t seem to get​
​her out of his mind. He thinks about her all day every day. Angelica says she can​
​only bring complications and trouble to him and our family. She is upset with him,​
​which he can hardly bear. It’s Angelica’s handmaid, and she says he’s doing this to​
​make her jealous. He’s come up with tricks so he can find himself alone with this​
​woman. I knew that it would not last so long, but you can’t blame the girl wanting​
​to better her situation. Today the woman told him she was pregnant. She’s a smart​
​one, too she made a point of telling him in the place where she knew Angelica​
​would be able to overhear their conversation. And of course, she knew Angelica​

​127​
​couldn’t leave her fate and that of a baby’s in only Michael’s hands to figure it out​
​himself.​
​Angelica and Michael had always had a special bond, but Yuri had always​
​believed that Michael did not deserve Angelica the way that he did. From the time​
​they were children, Michael and Yuri had been thrown together, being close in age​
​when they attended family functions and had remained competitive throughout​
​their lives even when playing games. But in reality, nothing was ever really a game​
​to them, it was always who could do it better. In Michael’s eyes, Yuri had​
​ultimately won the jackpot – the prize of all prizes. He had only been with this​
​other woman to try to make Angelica jealous, but it hadn’t worked.​
​“He’s my best friend, I can’t not help him,” Yuri wrote in his journal, wrote.​
​“But how? What do I do to make things right for all involved?” But that seemed​
​like an impossible mission. how​
​The handmaid (*** look for name in earlier part of book or come up with​
​some name and we will name her.)  s fo proceeded to be sent to another house of a​
​distant cousin where she stayed in hiding until she gave birth. Then they would​
​deal with what would be done next.  But when Angelica and Yuri saw the child for​
​the first time, and when they held her in their arms and saw her sparkly eyes​
​squinting and smiling back at them, and that Englehardt nose and chin, they knew​
​this child were to anyone had to be kept close. They couldn’t betray the secret of​

​128​
​her birth or who her birth parents. It would have brought too much pain and​
​embarrassment down on her and the rest of the family and she would have been​
​mocked and teased and set up with bad marks before her little life began. At least​
​she would have a chance to make her own way without the burden of being a​
​bastard. oo m held her in their arms and then Michael saw her too, it was clear they​
​couldn’t just give her to anyone. “She’s family,” Angelica reminded all of us. So I​
​found myself a key player right in the thick of their scheme; one that came out of​
​good intentions but would one day blow up like cannon in our faces. Angelica​
​called it “the best answer to a bad situation.”​
​I know Lillya, if you are reading this now, you are more than curious, you​
​are also furious that I could have kept this from you for so long. I’m sorry, but I​
​swore to your mother and your cousin Michael that I would never say a word. The​
​baby’s mother was set up in Perm where she was only expected to do light​
​housework as she was nursing When the little girl turned three, it was decided she​
​he would come to me and I would be her unknown guardian and caretaker.​
​Although anxious and curious to see the name of this girl,and see if she​
​knew her, All that Lillya had absorbed had left her very tired and as much as she​
​wanted to  continue, she found that she could not read another word.  Tonight what​
​she wanted most was a god sleep. She had dug deep enough for one day. The rest​

​129​
​would have to wait Besides, if she did not come to bed soon, Anton would get​
​worried.​
​The baby was smart and alert and seemed to be able to mimic perfectly​
​whatever myself or Michael would do. Angelica also wanted the baby to be taken​
​care of and not just given to anyone, so she approved of Michael letting this​
​woman and her child live in our house in Perm until the baby got older.  However,​
​the more days she spent in our presence, the more attached we all became, and so I​
​vowed to myself that I would set up a situation where the handmaid and this baby​
​could remain. I don’t know how we came up with the name, I don’t remember​
​what it meant to Michael or the handmaid, but we began to call her Natasha. If ever​
​my daughter Lillya reads this, she will be both angry and pleased at the same time,​
​for her best friend is truly her cousin, but the child stands a chance at a better life if​
​no one knows this, otherwise she would just be thought of as the bastard. If we had​
​made this public simply for spite, Michael would have lost everything, especially​
​his wife Gretta whom at the time he was engaged to. Gretta had already gone​
​through the difficulty in accepting that her soon to be husband had always wished​
​that Angelica was his. Now he had a child with her maid. In order to make peace​
​and not cause a huge family scandal or bring shame on an innocent child, Michael​
​asked me for a favor and I could not say no!​

​130​
​Lillya was shaken, almost going into spasms. Here she was, an older woman​
​– a grandmother herself, and she never had known this. How could my father have​
​done such a thing and not told me? That must be the secret my father’s been​
​keeping. All these years. Lillya became so full of emotion she was like a hot air​
​balloon full of scattered emotions. Wanting to find its way about to burst. Lillya​
​wanted to pick things up and break them, she was so angry. All the years she had​
​spent with her father and Natasha. “I wonder if Natasha knew?” she said to herself.​
​“How could they have done this to me? How could they have done this to her?​
​Propriety, what does that mean? What sorts of promises to you keep for a lie, and​
​why? I hate them in this moment. But I know the moment will pass,” Lillya​
​thought to herself. “Oh, this caste system has caused too much pain and suffering​
​and is not of any use.” She tucked the journal back into her bag, cried herself to​
​sleep until Anton came back to the carriage house later that same day.​
​NEW CHAPTER  or   ***​
​Lillya spent her time being very solitary those first months after she returned from​
​France. Anton was beside himself with frustration. He had counted on a lot of​

​131​
​things, but not this and not with Lillya.  He wrote her notes and called upon her​
​father asking if he might have the pleasure of her company. He hoped her father​
​could be more persuasive, but he got the same answer as the rest of the boys and​
​friends had gotten, even Natasha. Lillya, simply put, had her father tell everyone​
​that she was engaged in a project that required all of her attention, but it would not​
​last forever. And to Anton she had her father add she would be free soon and she​
​looked forward to seeing him.​
​Finding it almost unbearable to have Lillya so close but at the same time so distant,​
​Anton left flowers daily by her door and short notes to not take up too much of her​
​time and he let her know how much he missed her. Still, as difficult as it was for​
​him, he had been trained since childhood to be a patient man and his life in the​
​circus taught him to count and breath and sing his favorite songs over and over to​
​calm himself, to keep his brain still and remain pointed on a single destination. It​
​was how he made it to the other side when walking the high wire, and if it worked​
​in that capacity it should work in every other, he assumed.​
​Lillya remained quiet for weeks. She believed if she wanted something badly​
​enough, it would come to her. The only person she spoke to was her father and then​
​only at breakfast and the rest of the day she whispered commands to her horse​
​determined to stay pointed. And Anton focused on his long-term goal of proposing​
​and marrying the most extraordinary girl he had ever met. Lillya. Yes, she was it​

​132​
​for him! Word began to spread. The secret Lillya had been perfecting was about to​
​surface .Her  timing seemed to be just right. She had stayed away long enough to​
​be missed but not so long that she was forgotten. This was the year when all girls​
​of a certain class were waiting to be introduce to their future suitors and soon to be​
​husbands and there was no one poised to make a bigger splash than Lillya.​
​Petra, Anton’s mother grew more respectful of Lillya and more curious as well.​
​“This is one smart girl. I wonder what she is up to? I’m not certain if I did you a​
​favor by introducing you, but I believe you will never be bored. “She seems as if​
​she could fit in anywhere. She will keep you on your toes, of that I am sure .The​
​girl knows what she wants. She’s no ordinary girl.” She told Anton. “So you can’t​
​treat her like the others.”​
​Petra encouraged Anton to invite Lillya to something she knew Lillya could not​
​refuse, even if she wanted to. Something Petra could see was brewing in Lillya’s​
​soul and she decided to take full advantage. Carl Magnius Hinne’s  who had​
​created quite a fortune and was known to be rather extravagant had built a circus in​
​St. Petersburg. Anton who had been looking for another gifted rider had hired a​
​recommendation that had come from one of his cousins. At the last minute the​
​man’s wife decided she couldn’t leave her family and now Dimitri was left with a​
​cancelled starring act that would attract top dollar ad no one to fill it, but Petra saw​
​things differently.​

​133​
​“Dear Lillya, my family invites you to join us in the circus riding rink to display​
​your skill for the world to see.” signed Anton.​
​Lillya’s father Yuri and her best friend Natasha had been waiting and hoping that​
​Lillya would share her letter with them, and this time she was too excited to keep it​
​all to herself, and she did. “They’ve invited me into the circus.”  Lillya said as she​
​came running towards them.​
​In that one moment, Natasha knew what she had feared would happen one day was​
​about to become real.  Lillya loved Natasha, but she loved her horses and her​
​riding more than she loved Natasha or herself for that matter.​
​“With your permission.” Lillya remembered that good manners would take her​
​further down the path, cross the bridge she knew she wanted to take, and land​
​where she was meant to be, but to get there she knew she had to defer to her father​
​and ask for his permission. Yuri knew he had no choice he could see it was his​
​daughter’s destiny, and though concerned, he was actually thrilled that his daughter​
​had an opportunity to pursue a dream.​
​Yuri, concerned for Natasha’s welfare, the next day went to see Natasha’s mother,​
​who still worked at a nearby estate but whom he had not seen in several years.​

​134​
​“I think you’re going to need to move if you want to stay close to Natasha.” Yuri​
​said to Natasha’s mother.  “Lillya will be moving on and Natasha is going to need​
​something tohold on to and a reason to wake up. “Perhaps I can arrange jobs for​
​you both in estates by the sea? Natasha has always loved the water.​
​“It’s not going to be easy separating these two,” said Natasha’s mother. “your​
​daughter has been the best part of Natasha’s life, but I’ll do what you think is best​
​because up to now you’ve been right all along. I thank you for your years of​
​generous hospitality. Where do you think we should go, after the summer?” she​
​asked.​
​“Let me put my mind to this,” Yuri said, a little uncertain of what would really​
​come next. “But you will both have good homes and jobs. Lillya has no idea what​
​the next step for her really means.” It’s going to be difficult for both of them.​
​***​
​Out of respect, Lillya addressed her reply back to Anton through Petra.​
​“Dear Petra, please tell Anton I will come to the circus this Friday. I would be​
​honored to ride with you in the rink that night. Would it be possible to schedule my​

​135​
​performance after Anton does his so I might watch? Thank you for this kind​
​invitation. I will see you Friday at 5.​
​Word spread quickly and the Vronsky Family circus had to open an extra set of​
​bleachers and two extra sections special box seats and they felt rather certain​
​would still have troubles fitting everyone in as a note had arrived before Lillya had​
​even left saying the Czar and Czarina would also be attending. They were not​
​going to miss something as exciting as this. The Czarina was already thinking​
​about lessons for herself. Unbeknownst to Lillya, a career was being established​
​before her first act and a reputation was built that would follow her the rest of her​
​life.​
​Lillya whistled the entire way back to her family’s estate. she felt a little tight in​
​her bones and had a sense that something bigger than what she could imagine had​
​begun. A big ball was rolling down a hill picking things up while still gathering​
​speed.​
​Natasha was beside herself with excitement and couldn’t wait for Lillya’s return.​
​“What will we be up to next” she wondered.​
​The soft low whisper that Lillya had been keeping private while perfecting this​
​secret had suddenly become a roar.  The women at the palace were all interested in​
​what Lillya would wear, the men and the czarina were interested in her hands and​
​her feet, for the empress knew that no one would dare try to outdress her.​

​136​
​Lillya couldn’t leave the estate until the early afternoon of the show. What began to​
​spread through St. Petersburg that th and figuring out the best costume Lillya could​
​wear. Lillya once again preferred violet like the tulips that used to grow in her​
​mother’s garden. They could not to fit everyone in. The best street performers lined​
​the entrance hoping to catch the attention of the aristocrats who had begun to show​
​their love of the art by hiring many of the same performers outside the building to​
​their parties. The circus in Russia given the history of the country was still rather​
​new and people were working hard to demonstrate their worth and earn a high​
​place in the thoughts of the dukes and duchesses, lords and ladies, princes, and​
​kings. That night Anton not only did his usual act, but he added something special​
​when he finished walking the wire he went to his platform, put on a clean bright​
​white shirt and he walked to the platform on the other side upside down on his​
​hands. Then he got to the end, put on a tuxedo jacket that was neatly pressed and​
​waiting for him and then he took his bow. And then he introduced his mother and​
​Lillya. The crowd roared for them both as they circled the ring doing acrobatic​
​tricks. And although Lillya was capable of doing all the same tricks as Peta, she​
​did not want to overshadow her in the show an she rolled off her horses back and​
​applauded Petra as she circled the ring standing upright on her horse’s back. When​
​Petra dismounted, she took Lillya’s hand and brought her to the center of the ring​
​and applauded her, then everyone in the building got up and bellowed their love of​

​137​
​the two and when Anton joined them and gave Lillya a big kiss, and she did not​
​mind.​
​“This is the girl I am going to marry!” she whispered to Petra, but Petra and Lillya​
​already knew this.​
​CHAPTER OF LILLYA OLDER FILL IN***​
​Lillya’s reputation had proceed her to the rink. Was she really going to be the next​
​sensation at the Palace, or was this just something that would last for hours?​
​Neither she nor the people knew the answer. But the women with the​
​encouragement of their husbands believed that she possessed the knowledge of the​
​secret art form that they had been dying to learn.  Now they had to figure out the​
​best path to her stables and her riding rink without being conspicuous. The men​
​would come to Yuri and Lillya’s house as if they just happened to have time to​
​watch their wife as Yuri’s daughter gave her riding lessons. Lillya did the usual​
​stunts, taught the women the usual lessons of safety; how to ride with their English​
​saddles and sidesaddles, how to exercise their thighs and push into the horse’s ribs​
​as they went up and down, trotting their way around the ring. As they improved,​
​they would canter and jump low cavalettes maybe a foot and a half high or so, and​
​when they finished cooling down in the rink, they would hold their horses’ reins​

​138​
​and bring them into the stable where the most important five minutes if the lesson​
​took place. It was at the very end that she taught them the lessons of the horse​
​ballet. She had two stallions that had become particularly schooled and were more​
​likely to behave while Lillya worked, teaching them the art of dressage. The men​
​were very discerning, and the women, it was the most fun that they had had with​
​their husbands since courtship. Just as the men desired their wives, they desired​
​learning this art equally as much and the women didn’t care that their husbands​
​were using them, for they got what they wanted. Their home was happier, and they​
​were using less laudanum to calm themselves down​
​Lillya and Anton rose to the heights of society and the Vronsky Family Circus​
​soared and profited. The Czar and Czarina invited them to dine and lavished the​
​circus with two lions to complement the two tigers they had already sent. One was​
​named Biscuit, the other Trudy; names they had heard Americans calling one​
​another. They all found it rather odd, but accepted it without question because the​
​lions would draw in a larger audience, and they came with a good story. They both​
​knew that good stories are never lost on an open ear.​
​On the night of Anton and Lillya’s wedding, people danced in the streets. What she​
​wore was kept a secret. Many were told she wore her riding clothes and special​
​pants that the Czarina had made up for her that gave her more traction on the horse.​

​139​
​Yes, Anton had won the key to Lillya’s passion, but one person was missing, the​
​one friend she thought she could never live without, and it broke Lillya’s heart in​
​two.​
​New Chapter:​
​Lillya and Anton spoke silently to each other as they had to address what Lillya​
​had discovered. How were they going to deal with the truth about Natasha and her​
​heritage?  Right now, they both had to agree that Natasha was safer by not being​
​associated with them. But, oh, how Lillya wanted to scream, “She’s my cousin and​
​she deserves much more!”  But did either of them deserve more? The Reds would​
​disagree. If they had not, Lillya and Anton would not have to be hiding and fearful​
​of their lives, their destiny, their future. Nikolai recognized the rift that had gone up​
​in the carriage house, even though they continued playing cards and games in the​
​evenings and told each other stories that made them laugh. There was this​
​unanswered question lingering before them, and at some point, they were going to​

​140​
​have to answer it. Greta kept more to herself. This was a painful subject for her, for​
​the man that she loved and had planned to marry as a girl had already fathered a​
​child with someone else. Even though no one knew that this had taken place, she​
​knew, and she had carried this secret with her for decades. It had finally broken​
​loose and it was no longer hers alone to carry. Helena continued to try to be the​
​peacemaker amongst the six of them, always with a smile, always trying to make​
​the best of their situation. Sometimes, the officers would find a way inside​
​Nikolai’s church, making certain he included a service that was nonreligious that​
​looked away from God. Then, by contrast, the men who believed and fought for​
​the opposite side were fighting to hold onto their wealth while the other men’s​
​families were starving. It was a complex time. The lines seemed to be formed and​
​drawn and seemed as if it should be easy to decide where one stood, but nothing​
​was easy, because as they each gained a little something, they each lost as much as​
​well. Lillya got shivers up and down her spine every time the soldiers would come​
​to torment them, thinking that they were just one of the bunch of followers of God​
​and if they had to choose between White and Red, the Reds felt certain that they​
​would be the ones they would choose to be on their side. But Lillya didn’t really​
​feel like they had a choice. They were all born into a certain lineage and had been​
​raised according to that lineage. It was frightening. Lillya would hear stories from​
​friends about how one’s sister or brother had been kidnapped in the night and sent​

​141​
​to the front lines, forced to battle their brothers or fathers on the other side. But the​
​six of them kept on, through the ice-cold winter of near-Siberian temperatures and​
​struggle. and seeing the first blossoms of the following spring, the women by no​
​were more like sisters – sisters who loved and argued. They didn’t necessarily​
​agree with one another all the time, but they knew to save themselves. Each of​
​them was needed in their own way. Then one night it happened: Anton and Nikolai​
​were tending some of the parishoners; helping them with their chores, the ones that​
​were too difficult for them to do themselves, and Michael had stayed home that​
​night, feeling too tired to do any more work, while Greta and Helena had gone into​
​the main house to check on yet another pie they were baking along with a stew​
​filled with potatoes and leeks that they would eat later. Lillya thought that Anton​
​and Nokaolai had finished early and then she heard the footsteps of horses​
​approaching. She was a little bit concerned because usually the two of them made​
​more noise and would be talking and laughing yet this time she only heard the​
​footsteps. The steps leading to the front door of the carriage house began to squeak​
​and still there was no sound of talking and laughter. Lillya froze and opened her​
​mouth, but she was unable to get a sound out. She began to shake right at that​
​moment. Three tall healthy young soldiers that clearly wore the colors of the Red​
​jumped through the front door which had been left open and grabbed Lillya by the​
​throat. The youngest of the three men threw Lillya in a chair but then decided that​

​142​
​questions were better asked in private because clearly she was waiting for someone​
​to join her and it would be much easier to get the information they wanted to get​
​from her if she were by herself rather than them having to fend off who knows​
​what, how many, or how old. The only question that they asked was “how well do​
​you ride? Can you still get that old body if yours on top of a house or do we have​
​to carry or pull you ih a trug?” Lillya looked at them and realized she had no​
​choice but to go along with what they said for if she screamed, she knew her Anton​
​and Nikolai would come running to save her as would Greta and Helena and​
​maybe some unknowing parishoners. She knew she couldn’t do this to the others.​
​For Anton it would be certain death, so she kept her mouth sewed tight and only​
​did what they asked or said Still, she had a pretty good idea as to where she would​
​ultimately land, but she didn’t know what they would do in the meantime and how​
​they would treat her along the way. They took her horse but left the others that they​
​found in the carriage house below. They knew that whoever the horses belonged to,​
​they would come after them once they realized that Lillya was missing, but the​
​horses that Lillya and Anton had been using were old workhorses that could not​
​stand up to the stallions the soldiors were riding . As a matter of fact, they had​
​Lillya ride on the back of one of their horses and eventually let the workhorse run​
​free on its own because it was only going to slow them down and put their own​
​lives in danger. Lillya said not a word, for she knew why they had come and what​

​143​
​they wanted. She was to be an example of those who did not stand with the people​
​even if they did not stand with the White as well.​
​When Anton reached the house not soon thereafter, Lillya heard the echo of his​
​yells and could feel the pain in his heart. Her heart broke in two as she not only​
​loved this man but had adored him for all these years and she didn’t know what to​
​do except to not draw attention to him and bring him closer to an ill fate because if​
​the soldiers got to him it would most likely be the end of a love that had been​
​nurtured for years and Lillya couldn’t bear the thought of having done that to him.​
​[They stuffed a handkerchief in Lillya’s mouth, took her hands, and tied them to​
​the back of her, and let her know in no uncertain way that she would be dead if she​
​tried to get away. Thinking very quickly, Lillya, her only chance of survival was to​
​go with them She couldn’t scream or yell. She tro fight, and bit one of the officers.​
​Somehow, they had found out who she was and the family she came from – that​
​her mother had been an aristocrat and her father the wealthy owner of a large​
​estate. And although her husband had owned the circus and they had all​
​appreciated it when they were young, they had to take a stand now and let them​
​know what the challenge was. Lillya found herself, the next morning, with her​

​144​
​hands tied behind her back and one soldier making some tea for both she and​
​another one. Funny thing was, they made a tea out of bergamot. Lillya wanted to​
​bring to their attention that bergamot was the tea of the Czar and if they were​
​fighting everything he represented, they should not like this tea. They kept​
​blindfolds on her. She kept asking about what their decision was, and what they​
​were going to do with her. She didn’t ask about Anton because, if she was lucky,​
​they didn’t know about him.]​
​NEW CHAPTER​
​Vladimir, Lillya and Anton’s only child, was born on a cold, rainy night. The wind​
​howled, almost as if it was singing a tune addressing the gods and goddesses,​
​praying that everything would be all right. Lillya not only suffered the pain of​
​childbearing but she suffered the anguish of believing this might well be their only​
​child. She had heard childbearing could be quite painful, but she had had a strong​
​threshold for pain. But in the process of the birth, as much as she loved the thought​

​145​
​of being a mother and couldn’t wait to do the job, she had made a decision that one​
​heir was all they needed. But she did not let the pain get in the way of building a​
​strong relationship with her son, for she believed him to be a remarkable young​
​man with unusual talents and was the kind of boy who could touch the insides of​
​who he was and is and make a prize out of anything small or big. Lillya adored​
​Vladimir, loved to watch him walk the wire which he learned as a child from his​
​father as it was the duty of every Vronsky man, especially the heir, to follow in the​
​tradition of the circus. Vladimir was always jumping on logs, walking across​
​nature-made bridges that seemed to be bothersome to others, but were exactly what​
​he loved. He once saved a child from drowning and another from fear when the​
​boy’s house had caught on fire and Vladimir went where none of the other boys​
​would venture near. To save the boy, he climbed up an old tall tree that had one​
​large branch that extended to the window where the boy was trapped and​
​screaming, and he walked across the branch and told the boy to calm down; that​
​everything would be safe, and he would be at home soon. It was in Vladimir’s​
​blood to want to save people, and this time he did. A lesson he remembered well​
​later in life.but Lillya in the empty nights and moods behind and in front of her​
​often thought of the numerous nights sh and Vladimer woyld sit by the gigantic fire​
​in their living room play games of cards she had tought him.Even in the cold she​
​could feel the warmth of her sobs love for her.​

​146​
​As a boy, Lillya’s son liked to sing and dance and make up stories and every once​
​in a while, he convinced his friend Donatalia to make one up as well. But his other​
​favorite pastime came from the boy himself who loved to tell stories and embellish​
​the truths of what had happened for he knew he could capture people’s​
​imaginations with his words and the color of his language. When he was seven,​
​Lillya saved a letter he had written her, for he had just learned to write and yet​
​already she had something to put in the collection that would over the years bring​
​her great delight.​
​Dear Mama, he wrote, soon I’ll be ten and he tried to spell out the Imperial​
​Theatrical School. Even as a young boy, Lillya had to help him with his spelling​
​though she knew that would be hard for any ten-year-old. She found it rather funny​
​that he could come up with these big ideas and discover a way to make them come​
​true, but he couldn’t spell the words of what he was doing. (give example) He was​
​a bright boy, she was certain of this, and one that was empathetic to others and that​
​made her happy. She liked boys that had more girlish intuitions and she couldn’t​
​wait to see what would come next out of him. The country was becoming unsteady​
​and yet she couldn’t bear the thought that her own people could destroy themselves​
​simply out of greed and she cried at the anguish it would bring about but at night​
​when she rode her stallion with the wind blowing through her long wavy hair, and​

​147​
​she could hoot and holler as if she were a farmhand, the release of her true feelings​
​put a smile on her face for she was a determined girl who would honor the love​
​they gave to one another for, in her mind, he was a king.​
​He was fearless and Lillya respected and adored him not just because she and​
​Anton had made a beautiful child, but because he had the manners and the fortitude​
​to do something amazing, at least that’s what Lillya thought. She felt good about​
​having handed him the circus and looked forward to his letters that didn’t come​
​often now that he was a family man and a businessman as well. But every couple​
​of months she would find an envelope that came from a stranger who had gotten​
​the envelope from another stranger and somehow it had made it into her hands and​
​into her circus home. She loved getting letters like this, telling her about ---- The​
​last letter she got from him brought her happy news for he talked about his old​
​childhood friend and the daughter of her friend Katya, Donatalia Petroskaya.​
​Dear Mother, Vladimir wrote,​

​****INSERT NOT ORIGINAL​
​February 1​
​Lillya knew where she would be going. The closer they got, the more familiar the​
​smalls became. Even though the country was in the middle of a revolution, the​
​water and the flowers still smelled the same. The familiar scent Lillya had grown​
​up with and known since birth. The men were tough, strong, and study and let her​
​know that they meant to do what they were doing. She was bound and tied and​
​represented her class; the class these men were determined to blow apart. She was​
​frightened, but she kept her fear in place, for being afraid was not going to do any​
​good for anyone. She knew that Anton had to be frantic; even if he was about to be​
​sent to the front lines, he would be more afraid for Lillya than for himself. She​

​149​
​wished she knew where he was and what they might have planned, if anything,​
​after all Anton was still a circus man. They put a bandana over her eyes. She found​
​that rather silly as everyone in Russia knew where she would be taken. So she​
​played games with the light, or lack of light. And she would squeeze her eyes​
​really tight until stars and clouds appeared. She still needed to see the truth of her​
​situation, but she knew that would come very soon. She could hear the water​
​dripping from pipes and could feel the dampness in the cavernous stone walls that​
​surrounded her when the man opened the prison door. She put her hands up and let​
​the palms of her hands touch the stone. She wanted a better sense of her​
​surroundings. She knew she needed to know exactly where she was placed in this​
​prison. She didn’t know if she would ever be able to use the information or if it​
​would do any good, but she felt it was a smart thing to do. She figured out very​
​quickly that there were about [GET PHOTOS OF PRISON] thirty steps between​
​each prison door. She could hear the men and women mumbling, but she didn’t​
​look to see who they were. It was enough to accept that she was where she was.​
​Stripped down by a female prison guard, she was put into a uniform that made her​
​look like everyone else. They were trying to take away her identity. It was part of​
​the war they were fighting. She didn’t know what would happen or what she would​
​be called upon to do the following morning, but for now they put her in a cell by​
​herself and expected her to be able to sleep. Her nerves were on edge, her stomach​

​150​
​was gurgling and upset. The echoes of the other prisoners made it impossible to​
​find peace and relax, let alone sleep. Their whispers seemed to bounce like a ball​
​from wall to wall and they grew louder the later they got into the night and she​
​couldn’t shut it out. The next morning, she was served a small bowl of something -​
​she didn’t know what it was or what it could be. She didn’t want to think about it;​
​it certainly didn’t come close by any means to Elena’s cooking in Kungar or the​
​biscuits Greta would make her or the fish her husband would catch for her. Every​
​once in while someone would yell out to let everyone else know they were still​
​alive. Lillya had never been alone before. She had always had her father, Natasha​
​and later of course Anton, and she felt very alone. In the past, she had a house full​
​of people whose job was to care for her. The strange man in the cell next to her was​
​whispering and humming and to Lillya’s ears sounded sorely out of tune. She​
​wondered how long she was going to have to listen to this and to begin with she​
​found out… all day. She was taken for a walk by one of the women guards who​
​told her she may not like the food she was being served but she should eat it​
​because she wasn’t going to be getting anything else. Lillya took Anton’s lead of​
​counting the days when they were counting the days it took to get from St.​
​Petersburg to Kungar - Lillya began to count the days she had been in the prison at​
​St. Petersburg, oh she had dreams. She wondered if her horse was still in the​
​pasture, whether their gardener or caretaker or her father’s companion had stayed​

​151​
​on, would he have been able to? She wondered who was still living and who was​
​dead? Most she hoped were in hiding like herself, or had they been unable to give​
​up their obsession of always being noticed because this time it would not have a​
​pleasant ending, most likely, and cared for first. how many people and who were​
​living on their estate - all these thoughts filled her days. What did they plan to do​
​with me?, Lillya wondered. Her imagination was too vast and she really didn’t​
​want to think of all the misfortunes they could have planned for her. Cleaning​
​toilets, she could handle. It would be a joy, considering what else they may have​
​had in mind. So she spent her days in a locked-up cell with ten minutes of exercise​
​and possible cold, cloudy weather when she went outside. The captain from the​
​cavalry stopped in to see her one day. She could not imagine why. But it turned out​
​he had heard the rumors of his prisoner, Lillya, and how she could make magic on​
​a horse’s back. He wasn’t very friendly or kind, as a matter of fact, he stuck a pistol​
​to her head and demanded she follow him out to the barn where all the horses were​
​kept. He told her to pick a horse; that they were both going to ride. Lillya became​
​extremely fearful and asked him where they would be going. He didn’t answer her​
​but kept on walking forward. Lillya sensed that she was in trouble and that she had​
​only one choice and that was to do as he said if she wanted to live. He shot a bird​
​overhead that was flying by, just to let her know he meant business and he had one​
​of the boys in the barn saddle up the horse and when he was through, he handed​

​152​
​her the reins. “Come,” he said, and she did. They entered a quiet part of the barn,​
​more isolated than any place she had seen thus far, and he said one word, “Teach.”​
​Lillya was rather confused. A captain in the Red Army asking her to teach him an​
​elitist form of horse art, but that was exactly what he was doing. His name was​
​Paul Blatsky. He was married to a French woman named Brissetta. He kept it very​
​impersonal, He was actually cold and rather mean to her, but she knew he was​
​drawn to her knowledge as long as she could show him something that meant​
​something to him, she would survive. Captain Blatsky came when he could. He​
​didn’t have any set schedule and he never told her exactly what he wanted and​
​exactly what he would give to have it. It was silent but understood. Lillya knew she​
​could not mention this to anyone, which made it more difficult for her among the​
​prisoners. She was too old for them to assume he wanted a physical relationship,​
​but they all wondered what did she know that would make the captain desire to​
​spend hours with her? For Lillya, it was the only time she felt free. The wind when​
​she rode felt like soap and water was being poured down her back, even though she​
​would ride until she was in a wet sweat, she felt clean and sometimes even hopeful.​
​She didn’t really want to imagine, what the other aristocratic men and women were​
​being forced to do, for it was too awful. If she could ride, cleaning toilets would be​
​a joy. She wasn’t afraid of hard work, unlike the other aristocratic ladies. She was​
​stronger and less frightened than most of the other women she knew. Her years​

​153​
​with the circus had made her stronger and more open, less afraid of approaching​
​the unknown. Determined and strong-willed, she wasn’t going to let her age and​
​the wear and tear on her body stop her from dreaming and finding a way to change​
​her situation. Lilly was strong and she had no intention of giving up. Being where​
​she was did nothing but inspire her, She was going to find Anton, go to Natasha’s​
​cave outside Perm, and she her grown-up grandchildren and her loving son.​
​Whatever it took, she was going to make this happen. She was a force to be​
​reckoned with when she got something on her mind and had made an internal​
​decision to follow and her dream.  ** csand find her way home to her family.​
​Hopefully, Anton would be there, too.  She had no intention of having her epitaph​
​say, “Lillya died in a cold stone wet prison.” She was going to live and she was no​
​longer bound to the rules that would make her​
​The strange man in the cell next to her continued whistling horrible songs,​
​humming out a tune and just didn’t stop. If the Reds wanted to torture someone,​
​Lillya was certain they had found the way. But these men believed that her station​
​at birth gave them the right to punish her. It didn’t matter who she was, what she​
​was like, or what she had done - just being born into the upper class made her fair​
​bait. For days she was just getting acclimated to the present. The past made her too​
​sad to think about, and the future seemed impossible. Every once in a while, Lillya​

​154​
​thought she recognized a familiar face - someone whom she may even have​
​possibly seen in the ball at the Winter Palace that seemed like worlds away but in​
​reality was probably only months or maybe a year. She quit marking the notches on​
​the wall, for they became too many to count and she felt lost in the numbers.​
​Sometimes the men and women would put out a twig to see if they could trip​
​someone just for their own entertainment. Lillya found it cruel and unnecessary.​
​She didn’t expect to be having fun in prison; she expected to find a way out, but​
​had no clue as to how to make that happen.  Then one afternoon, she noticed a​
​woman staring at her - one of the guards. She couldn’t figure out what the woman​
​wanted, but eventually she was motioned to come forward. She did, the woman​
​yelled at her and Lillya got upset, “Why did she call me over if she was just going​
​to yell at me?,” but as she was leaving, she noticed an apple in her pocket;​
​something that she hadn’t had before. She couldn’t even imagine what the apple​
​tasted like because it had been so long since she had had a piece of fruit -​
​something fresh, something juicy, something cold. She couldn’t wait to get back to​
​her prison cell although she didn’t know how she would eat it and not be noticed,​
​so she put it in her top right pocket and tried to have her breasts cover it. She was​
​afraid of getting caught, but could not turn down this gift, and slowly over the day​
​and night she nibbled it. The next morning, the same guard who had yelled at her​
​the day before happened to be assigned to keeping Lillya in line out in the prison​

​155​
​yard. And when Lillya left to go back to her cell she found half a pear in her​
​opposite pocket, this was the most exciting event that had occurred to her since she​
​got to the prison - someone was being kind to her, or was it kindness?​
​NEW CHAPTER - YOUNG LILLYA – insert Natasha piece​
​Natasha threw a fit when she found out what was going to be happening; that she was going to​
​be leaving the only home that she really knew, and even though she was a servant that had​
​been hired to take care of Lillya and keep her company, Lillya had become like a sister to her and​
​was family. Yuri was family, too. Lillya was off cavorting on some sort of picnic with her new best​
​friend Anton, the man she swore she was going to marry, and Yuri had sent her on an errand to​
​go the the estate where her mother was working. Natasha hated this part of Sundays, when she​
​had to go visit her mother. It had nothing to do with loving her mother or not; it was just that​
​she had moved down in life whenever she saw her, reminding her that she was merely a servant​
​in the end. She hadn’t seen her mother lately. Her mother just kept to herself, as far as Natasha​
​was concerned, and it was nice to see her mother, she thought, but she didn’t like spending too​
​much time there; she preferred being on the estate with Lillya and Yuri where she had free rein​
​and was looked upon by the other servants in a higher regard because with Lillya, Natasha could​
​do most anything she wanted. When she got to the house where her mother worked, she went​
​along to the back door as she was always told she had to, and when they opened she saw three​
​suitcases. It was very confusing to Natasha - Who would leave three suitcases at the door, she​
​wondered, and where would they be going? She wondered to herself, imagining what it would​
​be like to take a real trip. When her mother got to the door, she was dressed in a nice long dress​

​156​
​that was olive green and double-breasted at the top with big beautiful gold buttons.  She gave​
​her daughter a kiss, and instead of inviting her in, she told her to take one of the suitcases, that​
​she was going to need help. This made no sense to Natasha, but she did it anyway. Soon a​
​carriage came up the long driveway to the main house where her mother had a room, and her​
​mother looked at Natasha and told her to get into the carriage. “Where are we going and what​
​do you have in mind?” Natasha started to feel a little frantic and disoriented, for nothing her​
​mother was doing made sense. But her mother got a certain look on her face and Natasha could​
​tell that she meant what she was about to say. “I’m leaving,” her mother said, “and you’re​
​coming with me.” Natasha looked at her mother as if she were nuts. What did she mean by​
​this? Her mother said “It’s time for you and Lillya to be separated. It’s time for you to build your​
​own life, and today’s the day we’re doing it.” Natasha had nothing of hers packed and more​
​than anything, emotionally, she couldn’t imagine a life without Lillya in it day-to-day. They had​
​been together since they were children. How could her mother yank her out like this? And as​
​they drove down the long driveway, at the end of the driveway was Yuri, Lillya’s father. He had​
​packed up Natasha’s other things and had them ready for Natasha’s mother to pick up. He gave​
​Natasha a kiss on both cheeks and told her she would always be looked after and she shouldn’t​
​worry, but today was the day that both she and Lillya had to grow up and accept each of their​
​own stations in life and move on. “I know this is going to be difficult,” Yuri said, “Lillya, I’m sure,​
​is going to throw a fit when she comes home and finds you not there, but it needs to be done.​
​I’ve got positions for both you and your mother in Odessa. You will be near the sea and well​
​taken care of. Now, I don’t want to prolong this because it will be painful for both of us. l​
​appreciate what you have done for my daughter, but she needs to move on in life and it’s time​

​157​
​for you to move on in yours.” And a baffled Natasha got back in the carriage and rode off. She​
​couldn’t hold back the tears that were streaming down her face. She couldn’t have been more​
​shocked. It was as if someone had blown her out of a cannon, expecting her to find justice and a​
​reason for their actions, and that they were expected to be okay by her and clearly they were​
​not. She started yelling at her mother, “How could you let this happen? How could you let him​
​do this to us? Lillya’s really going to be angry - he’s going to be sorry. I thought he was my​
​friend.” Her mother took her hand and slowly patted her head of hair, trying to calm her​
​daughter down. She didn’t like the situation any better than Natasha did, but she knew they​
​were lucky to have a patron such as Yuri looking after them, and they had been given a position​
​and enough money that they would survive. And if they needed more, Natasha’s mother was​
​certain that Yuri would send it. So Natasha went on to Odessa, heartbroken and sad, feeling​
​betrayed by the one person she had most trusted in life. She had never thought about her​
​leaving; she assumed that she and Lillya would be bound together for life, but she understood​
​now that Yuri had never meant it to be, that he had some idea about Natasha but he hadn’t​
​thought it through completely, and now the day had come for her life as she had known it to​
​end and it would be time for her to plant new seeds and discover who she was as an individual​
​and what she was meant to do and see. They got to a new house that Yuri has set up and it was​
​a house where just she and her mother could live. She had never done that before, her entire​
​life she couldn’t remember when she and her mother had actually been together for more than​
​two or three days, but they were set up to take care of some children at a nearby house and at​
​night they would come back to their own. Natasha cursed when she wasn’t in the presence of​
​her new masters. She made life as difficult as she could for her mother, hoping that she would​

​158​
​change her mind and send Natasha back to the time when she was happy, but a week had​
​passed and there was still no sign of her mother changing anything about their new situation​
​and then two months, six months and a year, Natasha was still ranting and raving.​
​Lillya, on the other hand, threw a fit as well, but it didn’t last as long, for she had the distraction​
​of the man she loved, Anton, and a new position in the circus which kept her busy day and​
​night. Because of the Czarina’s acceptance and Lillya’s place within the palace and the​
​aristocrats, he could accept his daughter working - actually he was proud of his daughter​
​because she had become an equestrian rider whose skills were sought throughout the country​
​and his daughter was happy, though she missed her Natasha horribly. There were certain times​
​when Lillya would be going to an affair and oh, how she wished Natasha was there to help her​
​pick out a dress, get the right flowers for her hair, and encourage her, for Natasha had such a​
​high opinion of Lillya that it gave Lillya a higher opinion of herself. And over the weeks and​
​months she felt bad, but she found herself missing Natasha less. Her father had told her that​
​Natasha’s mother had gotten a job in Odessa and was going to be leaving, and it was only right​
​that her daughter was able to come with her. He let Lillya know that he had checked out the​
​situation to make certain it was safe and was one where both Natasha and her mother would​
​thrive, because Lillya needed to have the certainty that they would be all right. She felt a little​
​guilty because her sorrow had turned to delight, now that Anton was with her both day and​
​night. Petra and Lillya had formed a solid bond, and Petra become more of the mother Lillya​
​never had. Now that Lillya had this new prominent figure in her life and someone who​
​expressed love and warmth towards her, Yuri had actually begun to think that the decision he​

​159​
​had made was one that would be best for both Lillya and Natasha and he actually felt a little​
​puffed-up for thinking he was so smart and that he had done a good thing. He had taken care of​
​Natasha most of her life and made certain that for a person of her station that she had been​
​given an education as well and that she would have the tools to be worthy of good positions as​
​an adult and as time would move on, but Natasha did not see it that way. She felt betrayed  And​
​she swore she would not get close to anyone else ever again because she never wanted to feel​
​this kind of hurt again.​
​NEW CHAPTER​
​Peter Paul Prison, the fortress, was famous throughout Russia. It was built in the late 1770s and​
​was meant to protect the people of Russia from invaders that wanted to do her people​
​harm.The fortress was never used for defense. It was built by Peter the Great, who wanted to​
​construct on the Neva Delta a capital city that would inspire and put St. Petersburg in the​
​position of being a great modern capital and the fortress established Russia as the greatest​
​power in Eastern Europe. However, the Bolshevik government used it as a prison and a place of​
​execution.​

​160​
​The man with the voice who constantly sang out-of-tune voic and pounded out​
​annoying rhythms with his hands by hitting his ccot with any sort of piece of tin he​
​could find, continued to annoy her, on purpose she suspected. He wanted tan​
​adversary it appeared to help him pass his time. Lillya did not understand why he​
​would pick her What hwe she done?  During the night the prisoners sang out​
​different outmelodies with their own words to get simple messages to the others. It​
​could be as simple as taking a hymn they sang in church, one that every one knew,​
​and a man or wa man or woman whaling out their name and telling the others they​
​were e stsill alive.​
​During the night the guards couldn’t help but get a little sleepy themselves and​
​things that twould never get by them during the day sometimes went un- noticed in​
​the night.​
​let people know that they were alive and where they were, on the night of the sweet​
​pear, a sweet message came out of him, “She’s my daughter,” he sang. “She’s my​
​daughter,” he sang again, “She’s my daughter.” Later in the evening another verse​
​came out, “Trust her, trust her, she’s my daughter,” and Lillya recognized that the​
​man had been put into place to help her. All these months she had been cursing​

​161​
​him. Later that same day, the woman came again to take Lillya for her walk out​
​into the courtyard and she jiggled some keys that she had in her back pocket and​
​whispered in Lillya’s ear, “One night, when you least expect it, your door will be​
​open and it will be time for you to leave. There will be someone waiting for you - I​
​can’t tell you now who it will be, but my father recognizes your importance and​
​has arranged a way for you to go and not be seen.” Lillya shivered and started to​
​cough. It was hard for her to take in what the girl was saying and believe it could​
​be true. But then, she had nothing more to do than to better her circumstances,​
​which couldn’t have been much worse. And even if these other underqground​
​soldiers would use her for their own ploy, it was better than spending her days and​
​nights in the Peter Paul Prison all alone and she qoquld be able to see the moon and​
​stars and maybe find Anton, or her father, and even Natashs.​
​That night, a potato was put into her pocket and the man’s daughter, whose name​
​was Blinka, handed her the potato and told her she should try to barter it that night.​
​Lillya was caught and didn’t know whether she had done the right thing or not, but​
​if she didn’t have faith in Blinka, who could she have faith in? and she needed​
​someone strong to help guide her way out. Blinka made certain that Lillya was left​
​outside by herself, supposedly to pay for her crime, and it was shivering cold that​
​night and Lillya did suand not such  TUE BLOODED ONE AT THAT. ffer but​
​when she got back to her prison cell, Blinka left it open. She told Lillya to count to​

​162​
​a thousand as best as she could because by then she would be gone and her father​
​would be left to lead the way. But by now, Lillya had come to trust him. She knew​
​she was on an adventure, one that had thrown her off-course. Whether it would be​
​good or bad, she didn’t know, but this was the day that was marked for her and this​
​was the day she would go or stay there and suffer and lose self-respect.​
​ORIGINAL​
​Lillya recognized the smell of St. Petersberg air. She knew all along that the​
​soldiers would eventually take her there. She was a symbol and nothing more, and​
​she knew it. The men who were tying her up knew she had nothing more to offer​
​than representation of being an aristocrat. The ride from Kungar had been more​
​emotionally exhausting than physically exhausting and each step she took she​
​knew would take her further away from Anton. Of this, she was very sad. She had​
​been preparing herself for several years, so what was happening now was not such​
​a big surprise. She knew the day would come and it would be more than a goodbye​
​with her father or their old way of life. She agreed with the Reds on many levels​
​for she could see the greediness of her own class and couldn’t understand how they​
​couldn’t see that they were creating their own destruction. She counted steps as she​
​had done on her way with Anton to Kungar, wondering if they would match up.​
​She was blindfolded all the way. She listened to the boys’ conversations with one​

​163​
​another. For that’s what they were -- simply boys. Boys who wanted to feel they​
​had made their mark, cast a difference in the way and how their people, the​
​Russian workers and peasants, could live their lives. She wondered how their​
​taking her was going to make any difference to the world that these young soldiers​
​wanted to create for their people, but right or wrong, she knew they had to do it,​
​just to seek or believe they had sought justice for their own class, which had been​
​punished by the nobles and they wanted the nobles to know that they had taken​
​enough. Lenin, Stalin had all set out to seek power for their fathers, brothers,​
​mothers, friends and neighbors but the greed of their own hearts, she felt, was​
​going to be their rise or downfall just like the rest. She smelled the air as it began​
​to smell like her father’s estate. She knew they couldn’t be far and recognized that​
​she would soon be meeting the company of many that she knew because the only​
​place they could be taking her right now was Peter Paul Prison.​
​“Pray for the martyrs of the revolution,” she heard people saying and it got louder​
​and louder the closer they got. Rumors of the Peter and Paul Fortress had spread​
​across the country. It was the place where they took those that did not carry their​
​beliefs, where many prisoners of the upper classes were jailed and humiliated to​
​cut them down a notch or two. ironically, it was located directly across from the​
​Winter Palace where Lillya had once been celebrated and admired. In a weird way​

​164​
​that gave her strength that she never expected reminding her who she was and still​
​was inside. Listening to the soldier announcing their arrival, she had to steady​
​herself to take the next steps without showing the fear that she felt inside. She​
​wasn’t as calm as she tried to appear to be. Click clock, click clock – she could​
​hear the sounds of soldiers approaching. For a second the sound of the horses​
​approaching reminded her of all the wonderful equestrians she had met along the​
​way in the circus and before.  She even felt a little piece of Herve Laurent fly by​
​her and she wondered where he might be in the world and was he still the terrific​
​horseman he had been.​
​It was easy right now to let her mind wander to Circus days and wished she was​
​able to have contact with her son Vladimir. She wondered how their circus was​
​doing.  Circus had grown up and the American Circus’s like the Ringling Brothers​
​and Barnum and Bailey had really made a splash. Their circus had been more skill​
​and athletic then showing off large tamed lions and tigers. In this moment she had​
​a sense of what those animals must have felt being led inside their cages, unable to​
​run or escape or find a way out. In an undescribed wsyshe felt as if she were doing​
​penance for all the harm their animals had been through, not so much with their​
​circus because Anton and his family had had very strict rules as to how the animals​
​were to be handled.  But suddenly she felt bad about the many homes they must​
​have broken up, and she didn’t understand why she had never seen this before. She​

​165​
​had always felt she was in a higher place in the animal kingdom and if she treated​
​the animals with respect, she wasn’t doing anything wrong.  However, in a few​
​moments she would be like all the rest. Her freedom was about to disappear. She​
​did not know if she would ever see her family again or even the stars at night. She​
​would have no one to rely on. She had never really been alone. Here she was an​
​old lady, a grandmother she thought, and she had never had to fend for herself. She​
​had always been given everything.  Now she was like everyone else; she would be​
​given the exact amount of food that the other prisoners were allotted and soon she​
​believed she would be scrubbing toilets like the rest of them dressed in the same​
​dirty garments, eating the same uncooked hard potato hoping a scrap of bread​
​would be left that  she could use to barter, later.​
​Anton had sheltered Lillya from the street and the people who roamed them. He​
​didn’t think or know that she had learned a lot about street life by just watching​
​him. For the time being she would be unable to make her own choices, used as a​
​symbol of what society couldn’t accept and really, neither could she, but they were​
​raised to believe that they were born with a place already designed where they​
​would belong and be expected to  follow undefined rules. It was a matter of luck as​
​to how one would spend their lives who and what they could become and who they​
​were and what they could do. She had no choice but to be anything other than who​
​she had been raised to be. She kept thinking of Anton. He had been born to be in​

​166​
​the circus, not tied up in this mess with her.  Nikolai and Helena she presumed​
​would be ok and Michael would have bought himself and Greta out.  She was the​
​one that they wanted, the one that would make a statement and if Michael could​
​give them money, well, for now that would be enough. Her blindfold still on,​
​tighter than it had been since she had left Kungar, meant to incite fear and taunt​
​those that were brought to the prison and the soldiers who wanted to seek justice​
​for all that they had lost and given up or never had. When they opened the door to​
​the prison, the stench almost made her pass out and she could hear drops dripping​
​from drains of one sort or another, but she didn’t know where they were coming​
​from. This was the beginning of a new life for her. Her old life was scattered​
​somewhere in the dirt that she was walking on and her spirit was alive even though​
​she didn’t know where it belonged or where it would end up. What would happen​
​next, she wondered.​
​The foul odor was sentence enough, she thought to herself. The little bit of food​
​she had in her stomach started to rise to her mouth and she found herself bent over,​
​letting out every ounce of bad meat, bread, pig’s feet she had eaten along the​
​wayand ot krpt on coming and wouldn’t stop until she was bent over in pain. .​
​Men and women were calling out to her from behind iron gates, and thick stone​

​167​
​walls. trying to figure out who the new prisoner could be.and the soldiers​
​encouraged other soldiers to get close enough to frighte n Lillya, but not hurt her.​
​They had to be able to show her off first!  And fear rose in her body just as they​
​wanted it to. She felt like a  volcano about to erupt.Their goal was to intimidate​
​her, and they did.  Lillya  wanted to cy but she refused to give them that​
​satisfaction..She was going to have to be strong and it began here.​
​“ How can I be so close to home and have it all so different? This is not the St.​
​Petersberg I have known and loved. These are not the same people I have known​
​and loved all my life. Then she took a deep breath, counted to 10 and walked in​
​using the cold hard wet rock to guide her way.What she discovered ws aa series of​
​winding stone passages. And she tried to count each stone get a sense of where she​
​was, the direction and how far she was from the door to the outside; her freedom.​
​She wanted to know this. Finally the inmTES GOT TIRED OF HEARING THEIR​
​OWN VOICE and they stopped.stopped. They talked amongst themselves for​
​several minutes, then opened the door and pushed her into a cell that was as dark as​
​the blindfolds they had when her eyes were covered. She had been trying to hold​
​her breath hoping to avoid the peutrid smell, but that was useless. She called out​
​“Is anybody home?”she asked the guard to show she had not lost her humor​
​entirely. She could hear the water dripping and echoes of all the strangers that​
​together made one sound. The bittersweet note that would ring in her ears for many​

​168​
​days and weeks and months to come. She didn’t want to give the soldiers the​
​feeling that just by catching her, finding her, they had won the war between them.​
​Sheforced the pain to go away if only briefly and  stood very proudly with a​
​sincere look upon her face that she was not afraid even if that wasn’t the truth. For​
​she was determined that she would make the best of a horrible situation and find a​
​way out but she had no idea with whom or how it would take place.​
​The prison door slammed behind her and all the little noises she heard along the​
​way to reaching what would be her final destination there for the night seemed to​
​echo and get louder. A cacophony; an orchestra of delusion and pain for everyone​
​had their own idea as to who to blame and what would be taken away and what​
​would remain.​
​She felt like a child once again, hiding in the stables of her father’s estate in the​
​dark, unable to see the invisible creatures that would frighten her later, as she tried​
​to sleep, knowing that she could not. In the far-left cell from where she was placed,​
​an old gypsy woman was singing a song about love and pain. As sorrowful as her​
​voice could become, she continued on. Lillya found herself secretly admiring her​
​because she told the truth and shared her feelings. Gypsies were not very​
​well-received most anywhere, but in this case, the Reds had put them and filed​
​them in the same way they had their aristocrats. Lillya was later to find out the​

​169​
​woman’s name was Rosa. Rosa was curious about Lillya, for she appeared​
​different than many other aristocrats Rosa had come in contact with. Even in this​
​darkened state, Lillya had more of a feeling for life than the others, who just took​
​their imprisonment as defeat. Rosa kept to herself, and the prisoners would walk in​
​sets of ten at different times in the middle of the prison. Lillya thought about Peter​
​the Great, and wondered how he would feel about his fortress being used in such a​
​way, but she devoted her mind to not focusing and concentrating on things that she​
​couldn’t control, but instead on seeing relationships that she might develop and​
​find a way out of there.   Lillya did everything she could to keep from vomiting up​
​what little was left in her stomach. Not even a thin mattress could be found, and the​
​officers spat on her. She didn’t think her cell could get any darker, but then night​
​came.  Stripped of her clothes, she was given dirty garments in their place and all​
​jewelry that she had on was confiscated. The solitude was the worst of all. Lillya​
​knew she was alone; she just didn’t know how many years, months, days, hours,​
​that would be true for her. Then, out of nowhere, she heard a dark, deep voice, “I​
​can see you’ve never been here before.” Afraid to be silent, but more afraid to talk,​
​she curled her body on the cot, hoping not to make any noise, thinking that if she​
​was very quiet, he would think she was no longer there. She knew her thoughts​
​were not rational, but she didn’t want to believe her situation and the man​
​continued. “I heard you were coming. You have no worries. We may not eat so​

​170​
​well, and the boys can be a little rough, but they don’t put you in the same category​
​as some of the others. You’re lucky your husband owns a circus. Who does not​
​have happy thoughts of visiting it as a child? I myself ran away once, wanting to​
​join the circus.” Lillya shivered in her corner and did not say a word. He could be a​
​plant for all she knew, and then where would that lead her?  “Don’t be afraid of​
​me,” the man continued. “You have to trust someone within these walls.” Lillya​
​tried to shut out the voice. She didn’t want to hear what he had to say. It was too​
​much for her to take all in one breath. A shiver went up her spine.​
​Cupping her hands over her ears, trying to cut out the noise of both the drops from​
​the pipes and the stranger who was seemingly in the cell next to hers, thoughts and​
​voice. She couldn’t believe how thin the cot was that they gave her. She didn’t​
​know how they could consider it a bed. She lay down first with her eyes open so​
​they could get adjusted to the dark an then she shut her eyes curious as to what she​
​would see. At least she didn’t have the blindfold on any longer, although there was​
​as little to see now with her eyes open as earlier there was with her eyes covered​
​and her hands shackled. She was afraid, but she didn’t want to admit it. She had to​

​171​
​be strong, and this time she had to be strong for herself. She could think of no one​
​else at the moment – her friends and family in Kungar would all have to be doing​
​the same.  She started to imagine, in the dark, herself riding her father’s stallion,​
​the wind in her hair once more, reminding her how strong she had always been and​
​how brave and strong she was now in this present moment. Being in prison was​
​certainly an obstacle and not a pleasant experience, but she had things yet to​
​accomplish, people she needed to see – Natasha still being the main one.  She​
​wondered what things might be like for her when the next light came. She was​
​curious as to what her routine would become and how she would live day-to-day –​
​what they would feed her and how bad they would treat her. Would she ever see​
​Anton again?​
​Lillya found her stomach starting to disappear. She thought of the good meals they​
​had cooked in Kungar and how her stomach had been getting big. The days passed​
​and she believed weeks and months did, too. When she first got to the prison, she​
​followed Anton’s example of their journey from St. Petersberg to Kungar by​
​making notches on her prison wall so she might know what day it might be and​
​how long something had actually taken her, but after a while she got confused and​
​she just gave up altogether. What did one day mean over another? She found it​

​172​
​useless, and that frightened her because she didn’t care. She knew she would never​
​get out of there, so she had to do it to give herself inspiration and a reason to leave.​
​The exercise ground had a couple of trees and Lillya had ten minutes of fresh air a​
​day. Lillya was able to wash once a week and always left with a chill that lasted​
​through the night.  Served hot water and black bread and was grateful.  Lillya​
​prayed every night but as time passed, she became uncertain for whom and​
​whether it was for death or life. But then one day a female guard left her an extra​
​piece of bread and the following week a piece of fruit.  Eventually they began to​
​converse and slowly Lillya found there was a spark of life still inside of her.  But​
​one day a nasty prison guard who had not an ounce of heart left in his soul,​
​discovered the female guard handing her an apple.  Lillya wasn’t allowed outside​
​for one month and if that wasn’t enough the female guard who had been so kind​
​disappeared.  Things calmed down again and Lillya was given five extra minutes in​
​the courtyard and eventually she got to be outside in both the morning and​
​afternoon. The man in the cell next to her continued having one-way conversations​
​with her, but she remained steadfast in not answering, believing it could only lead​
​to trouble.  He continued talking, for he had no one else to hear him, and he had​
​much to say about what was going on in their country. He used to carve little​
​pieces of driftwood that one of the soldiers would bring to him and for a short​

​173​
​period of time each day, he was even trusted with a knife to make the faces and the​
​legs and arms out of these little pieces of wood, and he gave them to the soldier to​
​take home for his children to play with, and they developed a friendly relationship.​
​Lillya listened to what the man would say to the soldier, and after some time,​
​realized that the man had a motive to his mission. A woman guard, sent to clean​
​Lillya once a week, watched this interaction grow. Then one day, she brought them​
​an apple and split it in two and, without Lillya ever saying a word, they were​
​bonded into … Soon, Lillya found her voice as well. She had gone without​
​speaking to practically anyone ever since she had arrived. She discovered that she​
​had more in common with this woman in the prison than she could have imagined.​
​Their biggest bonding taking place over horses and riding and … Her name was​
​Julietta, and they developed an actual friendship, and to her great surprise, one​
​afternoon Julietta met her at the prison gate, Lillya believing she would be going​
​on her typical morning walk, but instead there was Julietta’s horse, bridled and​
​saddled. Julietta took the reins and handed them to Lillya. Many others in the​
​prison looked on in disregard, but for those ten minutes, Lillya flew through the​
​streets with Julietta right behind and the smile on Lillya’s face was almost bigger​
​than the horse itself. She didn’t know that she could be happy again and thought​
​that it would have been impossible, but here was proof that it wasn’t. When Julietta​
​had Lillya all to herself, she stopped and took Lillya aside and handed her a note​

​174​
​that could be kept only between the two of them and outside the prison. Turns out​
​that Julietta’s father had once run the popcorn, candy, and concession stand at​
​Dmitri and Petra’s (Anton’s parents) circus. So, unbeknownst to Lillya, Julietta had​
​known Lillya through her parents all of her life and she remembered the good​
​deeds his parents had done for hers and for her person, letting Julietta keep some of​
​the costumes that had been made for circus acts – bright colors: red, purple,​
​fuschia, gold, like the colors of some of the most beautiful flowers, dahlias, and​
​Julietta  played with these outfits and they made up much of what her family could​
​not offer her. Dmitri and Petra sought her father’s opinions, and she remembered​
​her mother telling her how the respect they had shown her father helped him to​
​grow and become a better man and if their Lillya was in the prison, Julietta knew it​
​was her duty to find a way to get her out. This was the first Lillya had heard from​
​Julietta; the first time she had reason to believe she might have a way to help find​
​Natasha and Natasha’s cousins’ cave.​
​Then one night she found her cell door unlocked.​

​175​
​(save filler for later)​
​and like Lillya, at the Cadre Noir with Herve, when she watched him practice his​
​lessons, so did the aristocratic men of St. Petersburg watch their wives. The women​
​had gotten more attention from their husbands then they could have imagined and​
​had the biggest smiles on their faces their aristocratic friends had ever seen. If this​
​young woman could get a crowd so excited by this can you imagine what will​
​happen when her secret gets loose.​
​Everyone was chattering about both Lillya and Anton. Slowly the other interested​
​boys let go of their hold as it became clearer and clearer that despite their wealth​
​and aristocratic good looks, Anton held the key to Lillya’s passions​
​New Chapter​

​176​
​William brought over a new deck of plain playing cards, nothing fancy or​
​prestigious like the Chas Goodall and Sons cards he and Yuri used to carry in their​
​back pockets most everywhere. He thought it would help them pass the time while​
​doing something fun and familiar Seeing them, Anton couldn’t help but reminisce​
​having taught his son Vladimir to play and how much he loved the game. Many​
​afternoons of his childhood had been spent playing cards with his father. And​
​sometimes Lillya would join them. Those were happy times and sometimes he​
​would drift and allow his memories to hang like clouds over his head as he had​
​missed him all of these years he had been in America, terribly. But as he laid out​
​four queens, he reminded himself that they had been saved from this suffering and​
​they were safe!  All four of his queens, his granddaughters and his son and his wife​
​Bella were safe and not having to deal with this craziness.​
​Lillya could see Anton going someplace far away and nudged him as they were in​
​the middle of a game and not alone. She did not begrudge him these thoughts, no​
​sometimes she was jealous. Anton could see the past so clearly at times she wished​
​that she could jump inside his head and live there.​
​Gretta had brought over a pie that was filled with meat and vegetables that they​
​would eat later. This was a time they had dedicated to fun and frivolity as the rest​
​was mostly filled with work and worry.  Even Nikolai joined them and played​

​177​
​cards. He had deemed them a blessing as they helped to take his parishoners and​
​put them someplace merry. It was seldom that laughter was heard except during​
​these special nights and hours. Why, just the day before members of the red army​
​had come into the church and were notating the names of those who  were praying.​
​Nikolai pretended to be busy cleaning the altar and just nodded his head trying not​
​to engage in conversation. This time it worked.​
​Lillya loved to see how each of them looked with a smile on their face. She could​
​see them that way when they were young or how they must have looked in better​
​days.​
​Lillya recognized that she had become a master of disguise. If her years had taught​
​her something, it was how to look like someone else. However, it wasn’t hard to do​
​as these days she barely recognized herself. When she saw her reflection in the​
​nearby creek, hardship, time, and sadness stared back at her. They had taken their​
​toll. The wrinkles on her face had dug in deeper and made a permanent home. She​
​named the most pronounced ones after female mythological characters. One she​
​dubbed Athena, for her intelligence and wisdom, another Demeter, for her power​
​over food and plants and her connection to the afterworld. The deepest crease​
​became Aphrodite, because it was her memories of love that sustained her.​
​Accompanied by these goddesses and great determination, she found the strength​
​each day to keep on living.​

​178​
​Lillya was a late owl and would fall asleep long after Anton. Most nights she​
​stayed up late, long past the time Anton fell asleep, so she could sneak into her​
​father’s journal and learn more about him, his thoughts and their family. During the​
​day she usually did things with Helena and Gretta. She was easily accepted by​
​those she met, but she had disguised herself in this instance as a woman who spoke​
​very little and was not very sociable with others. She had a fence the parishoners​
​thought that kept everyone but Gretta and Helena out. It’s not that she didn’t like​
​the others or that they misliked her. ‘she had built a block around herself because​
​she knew if she started talking in easy conversation her disguise would be​
​shattered.​
​After a while she sometimes felt a misjudged sense of security. She began to find​
​some peace in not moving and the similar grind of each day tied her down and left​
​her quiet. The candle that had shined so brightly all these years seemed dim and​
​she was having trouble finding her way and figuring out what she still believed in.​
​She wondered about her father. She imagined he had become as fragile as a piece​
​of old parchment paper, that if not carefully treated would crumble and vanish.​
​Truthfully in her heart she believed he was probably dead for in a way she had​
​always thought it was her who kept him alive. She gave him his raison de etre,​
​Lillya said not a word about Natasha to either Gretta or William, but after time she​
​became clear as to the type of man her cousin truly was and who her father became​

​179​
​as a result. A lot of anger festered in her older bocy when she thought back to the​
​missing element of her childhood. She had not needed to be an only child nor​
​lavished with such presents. There was a part of herself that had begun to hate​
​herself for bring how she had been and for treating Natasha as the hand maid that​
​she was but shouldn’t have been.​
​She tried to go inside both her father and William’s heads at the time, and then she​
​remembered that she had to include her mother for she was culpable too. But when​
​she thought of her mother, she knew her mother was the voice of reason, and what​
​they had done had saved Natasha being put in an uncomfortable position for life.​
​This way no matter how difficult it was on Lillya, it enabled Natasha to be free.​
​Then one afternoon Gretta came to the carriage to sew with Lillya and later they​
​decided to take a walk. Before Gretta’s arrival Lillya had been reading snippets of​
​her father’s journal and had quite come out of that world when Gretta came​
​knocking on Lillya’s door.​
​For a while they laid down the pants and shirts that both William and Anton had​
​that needed to be mended. Both pretended to have normal conversation but there​
​was something that had come between them that neither had been able to speak​
​about. After several hours of sewing they prepared themselves for the outside, each​
​more silent than normal.​

​180​
​Breathing the fresh air, Lillya opened her eyes wider more awake and aware of her​
​feelings. Gretta stared back at her with a look of longing as if she had eaten her​
​words and wanted to spit them out. Finally, she did.​
​“You know,” she said looking at Lillya as if she believed Lillya would be aware of​
​what she meant when she said this, and Lillya did.​
​“Yes, I do,” Lillya said solemnly.​
​“And you have not told William this. Am I correct?”​
​“Yes, I have kept this to myself. I would say something, but I believe you know​
​most of the story. I am sorry you have suffered so, it would bring anyone pain. It’s​
​hard to imagine your forgiveness, but for me she became the person besides my​
​mother and father and Anton to whom I loved most and counted on more than​
​anyone else.  She was my best friend, so my thoughts are mixed. Still, I want you​
​to know I have sympathy for you though I don’t believe that is what you look for.​
​I can’t tell you how I know this, but it has recently been brought to my attention​
​and I assure you I was shocked, but in a way, I wasn’t. There has always been an​
​unusually close bond between myself and Natasha and now I think I understand​
​why. I think she might be in Perm and I would like to try to find her, but I know​
​that would open more wounds for everyone I believe but me so I’m uncertain​
​whether to be selfish or leave things as they are?​

​181​
​Gretta responded, “We are grown now, Grandmothers and Grandfathers, but I’m​
​not sure if the pain has lessened or if it will be worse.”​
​“For now I will keep it to myself,” answered Lillya, and they continued their walk​
​in the woods in silence listening to the animals and birds talking to one another​
​trying to measure how they truly felt about the situation but unable to share their​
​thoughts for the wound had just opened and was too new to know how they could​
​live with it again.​
​For weeks after, Lillya felt like a train that had come to a halt and rusted over. She​
​could barely move and when she did she felt like an old piece of equipment that​
​had lost its meaning and ability to do what it was brought on this earth to do.​
​The three couples continued to keep each other occupied but a sense of uncertainty​
​seemed to linger in the air. No one seemed to be quite sure as to where they stood.​
​Helena tried to keep everyone happy. She laughed even at the smallest joke and​
​always tried to bring something good to the table whether it be food or attitude.​
​Anton just took it as the anxious feeling folks get after being cooped up in a small​
​space staring at the same walls having the exact conversation night after night, not​
​wanting to face the fact that they had come to a state of boredom brought on by​
​their untruthfulness with another. It was as if everything was stuck. But how could​
​they break loose. Finally, Lillya opened her mouth and just blurted out, “I’m going​
​to look for Natasha.” William’s face turned white with shock, Gretta’s face turned​

​182​
​red in anger and betrayal, Anton knew he would stay by Lillya’s side no matter​
​what she did. Nikolai gave a look of seriousness knowing that Lillya’s venture​
​could lead to trouble for all, and Helena just stood there with a quizzical look,​
​utterly confused  not understanding what was happening. It was said, the secret that​
​had been lingering and being carried on the backs of family loved ones and friends​
​had gotten to heavy and there was now no turning back.​
​“When did you find out and how?” asked William.​
​Silence struck the carriage house like a bolt of lightning.​
​Anton stood with a look of surprise wondering, “what is my wife talking about and​
​why didn’t I know”​
​Lillya looked at Anton with a face full of guilt.​
​I’m sorry she said, but I made a promise, one that I can no longer keep.”​
​“I don’t understand, Anton said again.​
​“If you will be patient with me and just listen, the truth will be revealed,” Lillya​
​went on.​
​“Perhaps I should be the one who tells this story as I am the one that caused it,”​
​William intervened.​
​“If you don’t mind, I’m going to leave,” said Gretta. And she silently walked out​
​the door, no goodbyes. She just put on her coat and left.​

​183​
​Lillya knew she had opened a box that had been closed for years a and before​
​examining the contents, like an old musty box, filled with cobwebs would have to​
​be gone through and thrown away before they could see what was there.​
​Helena looked at Nikolai hoping for some look of recognition, that he would have​
​a clue as to what had just occurred, but he looked as unknown as she. Lillya could​
​see she was looking for an answer and broke in.​
​“To my knowledge, she said, he knows nothing.​
​William broke in and began to speak. Lillya could tell by the look on his face that​
​each breath he took caused more anguish and the  pain just permeated his body and​
​got deeper and deeper and went to the past through all that had transited and what​
​had been done and how he hadn’t seen his daughter since she was a young girl and​
​how she had never known him as “father.” Then he looked at Lillya almost​
​pleading for forgiveness. I’m sorry he ended. We did what we thought best and he​
​sat down on the chair next to him and didn't say another word until Anton spoke.​
​“I hate to say this my darling,” Anton said to Lillya, “but in this political climate it​
​is better that no one know, especially Natasha.”​
​Lillya in her heart had known this, but being so close to Natasha, being in Perm​
​made it so difficult to accept. She so badly wanted her near and to have one last​
​opportunity to love her like a sister, or a cousin, and declare her as hers.​

​184​
​The truth was out. There was no more to say for now.​
​William looked at Nikolai and Helena. “I must be a big disappointment to you.” He​
​said.​
​“We all can be, but it is up to all of us to do what we can to correct our mistakes. It​
​is not a time to be selfish rather it is the time to put your best foot forward and​
​learn to become the persons we’ve always hoped to become.”​
​And with that William walked out the door to try and find Gretta.​
​New Chapter!​
​Lillya and Anton unwrapped their many presents one more grand than the other. In​
​some ways it embarrassed Lillya to be surrounded by such grandeur, but the nobles​
​didn’t stop. They awarded Lillya with horses and pieces of art from around the​
​world and many times fine bottles of wine and vodka that came from the czar​
​himself, some of which she insisted on sharing with her father. Her notoriety had​
​spread but she could not imagine it crossing a continent, but it did. Little did she​
​know it had made its way to the Cadre Noir and into the ears of her once admirer​
​who by now was so boiled over in anger he would have been unrecognizable ale to​
​her. He had nothing but smiles and happy thoughts when she had known him as a​

​185​
​girl now he spit fire with most every word especially when news reached him that​
​she had borne a little boy named Vladimir.​
​He thought about the gypsy woman in the woods that day long ago remembering​
​how his body had been drenched in sweat and he had become delirious. “Did I let​
​her make a curse or was it just a dream?” he often wondered, but then how could​
​he explain the serpents skin resting next to him when he opened his eyes? That day​
​had become such a blur in his mind that he had become unsure, so he washed it out​
​of his thoughts as much as he could. Still, whenever he came upon travelers who​
​had been in St. Petersburg he wasn’t able to stop himself from asking if they had​
​gone to the famed Vronsky Family Circus and had they seen the famous equestrian,​
​Lillya, perform her act and when they said yes for a  minute or two  he imagined​
​her as he had seen her that first day in the woods in the Loire Valley galloping​
​standing upright on her horses back and he would be taken once again by her​
​beauty and talent. Then reality would strike him again and he would start spitting​
​out words of how Lillya wasn’t as good as she or the people thought. She like that​
​circus was only an illusion. Then he would stomp off leaving whoever he had been​
​talking to completely baffled and confused.​
​As Lillya and Anton’s child grew older Lillya’s first and only French boyfriend​
​began hearing rumors of her boy, Vladimir.  Like his father Anton, he had followed​
​in his father’s footsteps and become an expert at walking the high wire. He had​

​186​
​also been given the prestigious opportunity of attending the Imperial Theatrical​
​School, maybe the most famous schools of its kind in the world.  All opportunities​
​he felt should have been bestoyed upon his son, the one he didn’t have. But she​
​would get what was due her, he always thought. And when a rumor came to him in​
​the form of a secret note tucked under a silver tea pot with biscuits and flowers​
​surrounding it he thought justice had been served. Lillya had taken a bad fall and​
​the unborn child that she had been unaware of but nonetheless was growing in her​
​belly died. The doctor’s comment. Anton was told, “thank goodness she gave you a​
​boy before all this trouble.”​
​Anton didn’t know what to say or think. He loved his son, but he also knew he​
​would have equally loved a little girl, especially if she were as pretty and sweet and​
​talented as his Lillya. Anton was just happy he didn’t have to make these decisions​
​or uphold these ancient ridiculous rules of inheritance.​
​Vladimir was handsome and charming. He had a swagger a kind of presence when​
​he walked. A composure, people seemed to focus on him just as he focused on the​
​steps he took crossing the wire to the other side. He was almost magnetic. All the​
​girls were drawn to him at the school they all fell hard for him.​
​One special girl, whom Lillya would have adored him to choose was her​
​dear friend Katya’s daughter, Donatalia, a very talented ballerina who also attended​
​the Imperial Theatrical School, and like her mother had been, she too was also at​

​187​
​the top of her class and would one day be a prima ballerina. However, she was​
​three years younger than Lillya’s Vladimir.​
​It was a very sad story. Lillya felt a special affinity towards this girl for like​
​herself, Donalia had lost her mother, Lillya’s friend, at an early age; much too​
​young for any child! Perhaps that was one reason why Lillya felt closer to​
​Donatalia than many others. They were bonded by the trauma they had each​
​experienced.​
​***Liking the girl, while at the same time feeling a sense of kinship with​
​her, as they both had experienced terrible losses at a young age, Lillya would go​
​out of her way so that Donatalia would feel less alone and know that she had​
​another woman she could talk to besides her father’s partner’s​​another woman​
​she could talk to besides her father’s partner’s wife, Mary of Savannah, who​
​had been especially kind to Donatalia that first summer. She would invite​
​Donatalia to do things mothers and daughters would enjoy doing together;​
​after all, Lillya had borne a son, but she still liked sharing many girlish things​
​with someone who appreciated her sensibility and friendship. ​
​Lillya could tell by the way Donatalia fidgeted with her hands whenever​
​Vladimir entered the room or spoke to her that the girl had a crush on her son.​
​And she could tell by looking at Vladimir and the way he responded to​
​Donatalia that it was probably true for him as well, but three years was a big​
​difference at that age. Vladimir was getting ready to graduate from The​
​Imperial Theatrical School, and Donatalia hadn’t even struck her middle​
​stride. Donatalia was reaching up to the stars, wondering when she’d catch​
​one, while Vladimir was already shining like one. But it didn’t stop Lillya from​
​enjoying the offered friendship her son and Donatalia kept, thinking that their​
​crush was unknown to others,when to her it was perfectly clear. ​
​The Czar and Czarina requested that Lillya’s son Vladimir and her​
​friend’s daughter create a special performance for them and present it on the​
​lawn of the Winter Palace. It would be a private spectacle. Everyone would​
​know about it, which would create a buzz of excitement, but few would be​
​invited to see it. It put Vladimir in an enviable position among his peers and​
​Donatalia, well, just the sight of her became unbearable to many. Girls had​
​spent years waiting for a chance to be chosen to become the “prima” dancer at​
​the school just like Donatalia had waited, too, and she shared with Lillya her​

​188​
​dreams that one day she would represent her county, Russia, like Anna​
​Pavlova or Agrippina Vaganova. Then Lillya  remembered that day in the​
​coffee shop when Donatalia’s mother told Lilly about the conversation she had​
​with her daughter in this exact same spot about the tea for the Czar and all​
​about Bergamot, the dangerous path the men would travel through China and​
​take just to please the Czar and Czarina. She had heightened her nose and its​
​ability to remember a scent and how special was its flavor and that of the​
​delicate cardamom seed when it fell out of its shell. Like the stories Lillya​
​would later tell. The aroma of her tales was always potent and undeniable.​
​They were the kinds of stories people liked to pass on.​
​***​
​The torches had been lit. Grand Duke Sergei Alexandrovich started by​
​playing the melody to the empress’ favorite song, ---- on his famed flute and​
​everybody began to politely roar and clap their hands. Then the Czar signaled​
​the sign of silence with his hands. Not a sound could be heard other than the​
​sound of their breathing. Anton and Lillya had provided several courtly clowns​
​and two fire-eaters to make the evening more memorable and exciting while​
​the Grand Duke Sergei played a lively melody and the circus tigers Midnight​
​and Satin jumped through hoops​
​ The audience seemed as nervous as she had felt before remembering​
​the story of the tasty pot of tea. Lillya walked out onto the lawn with Anton​
​and was seated next to the Czarina, and when she saw her son walk over to​
​Donatalia and take her hand, soaked in Vladimir’s smile, she knew at once​
​that she had been blessed, when the Czarina smiled and nodded her​
​approval.  A nod like this from the Palace would open many doors, for not only​
​the children, but for the parents as well. ​
​At the first touch of Vladimir’s hand touching hers found Donatalia was​
​no longer fidgety and afraid. Handsome Vladimir, already well​
​known, especially to young people whose hearts he had already won, was there​
​to rescue her and lead the way. Then, like a magician surprising a crowd by​
​pulling a rabbit out of a hat, out of nowhere he took his first step. Astonished​
​by the perfect fluidity of her movement, Vladimir was hypnotized by her​
​ability. The way she picked up each leg and walked, and he watched as she​
​took each step and slowly drifted into what he referred to as the​
​otherworld, for she was gifted in ways he had never witnessed before.​

​189​
​Donatalia and Vladimir moved like butterflies, free in their motion, like​
​young Roman gods and goddesses, telling their story. Little did any of them know​
​what the future hold.​
​NEW CHAPTER​
​Lillya was not so secretive anymore about her father’s journal. It was clear it was​
​not for anyone but her and the stories it had to tell were written down for her and​
​for her alone. Things at the carriage house got a little more comfortable and routine​
​once again. The teapot’s whistle had been heard and its steam was given a way out.​
​Gretta, Lillya and Helena took walks most every day and actually discovered some​
​joy and laughter in their getting to know one another. Helena was the most​
​thoughtful one of the group. She naturally thought of others first. But she was very​
​careful and watchful over what was hers and what she felt she deserved to claim as​

​190​
​hers to stay hers and no one else’s. They didn’t broach the subject of Natasha very​
​often. She was the written off-limits part of their discussions and conversations.​
​Actually, surprisingly enough to Lillya, Gretta ended up being the most curious,​
​maybe because she had given up the most to stay married to her husband. Every​
​once in a while, she would walk into a room that would fall silent upon her​
​entering and she was rather certain that they were doing this not to hurt her, but to​
​protect her. Then Helena would come over with a big pot of tea and some​
​cardamom cookies and hope that her offering would bring about peace. Nokolai​
​gave his prayers to his parishoners on a daily basis and though the climate in the​
​country had gotten worse, no one seemed to ask very much. William went on​
​oblivious to anyone’s feelings but his own and Lillya tried to turn the workhorse​
​she and Anton had brought with them into a “real” horse, missing her riding​
​desperately and all that she had once been. Her identity of herself had become​
​quite blurred. Helena sometimes brought a new friend over to the house whose​
​name was Lana. Lana, not knowing the wall that had been forged between the​
​other three, sometimes left them frozen. The found freedom that Lana innately had​
​none of the others could share in because for them it was as if a giant spider had​
​trapped them in his web and left them  wrapped in the lie that had started many​
​years before; and it had become so twisted and ugly that like the spider​
​strengthening its trap, binding them to a life they now had to let go of. How they​

​191​
​would get out of it, Lillya did not know. She approached Nikolai to encourage a​
​private conversation amongst just them two, but when she did, she discovered a​
​layer of anger that she previously had been unaware existed. It made her pull back​
​slightly recoil and lighten their conversation. In those brief moments, Lillya had​
​decided Nikolai wasn’t as safe as she had taken him to be. Suddenly the search for​
​Natasha became that much more inparative.​
​Lana always brought laughter and fun with her but she also came with a certain set​
​of restrictions put upon the other the three other women. Lana’s husband, Anton​
​reminded Lillya, didn’t wake up worried every morning that someone could take​
​his wife for haaving been born into nobility , talent,beauty, and wealth.  She was​
​much more inconsequential and relevant to what was going on in her country,​
​whereas Lillya represented an existence that caused men to fight and give up their​
​lives.​
​Every once in a while, Anton needed to share a joke and laugh with his wife, add​
​alittle levity to their situation so she would knoq that the man she loved still​
​existed. It was important to both of their well-beings for him to see her smile and​
​tthat she see him smile , too. “It’s not your fault,” he often had to tell her. Then he​
​would grab her hand as if they were still teens and ogether they would go went​
​down to the creek and splash and           play in the cold sparkly blue refreshing​
​water. Their teeth chattering when they got out, they would grab a blanket and dry​

​192​
​eachother off . Anton would smile taking in the beauty of his wife and he would​
​tell her over and over, “everything will be fine. You just wwashed away all your​
​trouble and the fish have gobbled them up.”​
​Lillya never quit loving Anton’s attitude and spirit. He was her life line to the​
​world, her rock and savior. The trip to the creek only allowed them several minutes​
​in thte water, but Lillya c\cherished those moments as if they were dipped in gold.​
​to be in but still, They were refreshing and helped to wash away her sorrows and​
​past sins, Sometimes, they jokingly referred to it as their family’s baptismal, for​
​Lillya would swim over to Anton and tell her deepest secret of the day and he​
​would gently and lovingly push her head back into the water to wash any bad​
​thoughts she had away and she in turn would do the same for Anton. They​
​wondered what Nikolai would think about them acting as the high priest and​
​priestess of their own lives, but it was a way for them to feel clean not only in their​
​bodies but their thoughts​
​Lillya and Anton worried sometimes that Nikolai  might draw them into​
​conversations that were better left unsaid. Cutting out just about everything that​
​had meant something to her, her whole life before Kungar, it was harder than Lillya​
​had expected. She didn’t know how to break her identity as what she had done had​
​been what had colored her past and made her different. She was a flower lost in a​
​dark forest, trying to find the last ray of sunlight that was the key to the entrance of​

​193​
​what she had taken to be her life, but now this was real, this was her reality. She​
​was no longer the girl riding upright in her saddle or the one the aristocrats sought​
​to teach them dressage. She wasn’t sipping lemonade on the lawn of the Winter​
​Palace with the empress, she was stuck in a small carriage house with the same​
​people day in and day out and she had to force herself sometimes to be grateful.​
​Sometimes she repainted her image of herself inside herself so she could be​
​someone else and find happiness and what was now the truth for her. Helena felt​
​sorry for her because she could only dream of the life that Lillya had led and even​
​dreaming of it was more than she could imagine for herself. But the three women​
​stuck together, took their daily walks, laughed at the same jokes over and over,​
​planted watermelon and artichokes in the summer, and saw the seasons pass from​
​one to another. It had become boring, but it was a boredom they could live with​
​and one they actually treasured because if it was not for this, Lillya felt quite​
​certain, she would have joined the ranks of many of their friends. Her mind​
​wandered, wondering what had happened to many of the people that had gone to​
​that last ball that she had attended with Anton. Where is the duchess now that so​
​freely let the Lord under her skirt while dancing and eating and gorging their​
​bellies, their minds, and their bodies with food, sex, and indiscriminate love? The​
​court had tried their best to help the aristocrats realize that their indulgences were​
​only going to hurt them, but that was more than the court could see or want to see,​

​194​
​and so they went on with their orgies and unrestrained behavior. This civil war​
​between the Reds, the Whites and everyone else who had gotten involved in this​
​fight knew it was based in economics, power and wealth and the way out would be​
​for each of them to be less greedy in all of the above, but Lillya believed it seemed​
​impossible for any of these strong-headed men to come to the same conclusion, see​
​the truth, wear it, and dare the consequences.​

​***​
​The light reflecting off her pupils and the deep emerald green that surrounded​
​them, unlike the rest of her exterior sparkled like that of a young girl after her first​
​kiss and revealed that the rumors that had once been spread about her, were​
​probably all true.​
​The fire with the cast iron caldron on top, spit out flames. They would need them​
​to stay warm and have the soup she was making from weeds she collected that​
​morning and a bone she had stolen from a dog.​
​Tonight Lillya would sleep once again in an abandoned cabin with two women she​
​had met along the way. If only she hadn’t been such a familiar face, then she could​
​have traveled by train or boat, but unfortunately, now it was too risky.​
​It was safer to travel in numbers. Besides she wouldn’t be staying long, none of​
​them would, she told herself.​
​After gathering more wood for the night and eating what could barely be dubbed as​
​supper, Lillya prepared for a long uncomfortable night. The sofa that would double​
​as her bed, had springs popping through the worn fabric that were just annoying​
​enough to wake her up no matter whatever side she was laying on. Still, as she had​

​197​
​found out the night before, it was better than sleeping with the mice that were​
​scurrying across the planks on the floor below.​
​Things hadn’t turned out as she had imagined, but she spent little time feeling sorry​
​for herself. She had witnessed horrors and here she was still alive holding onto a​
​dream that fueled her body when it had nothing else. However, she did take​
​comfort in knowing her husband Anton, was not here to see her in this​
​predicament.​
​She grew up surrounded by the upper class and several relatives had married into​
​the aristocracy.​
​Many of No, she would keep a low profile, and keep on going. She needed to find​
​Natasha. Natasha would know what to do, but she kept that thought to her self.​
​***​
​Her father she had imagined had become as fragile as a piece of old parchment​
​paper, that if not carefully treated would crumble and vanish. It became clear as​
​they came up with their plan, he would stay behind and she thought about all the​
​faces they had known and lost with a great sense of sadness.​
​***​
​***Lillya placed more logs on the fire before curling up on the sofa. There was a​
​distinct chill in the cabin and the women each took turns through the night​

​198​
​attending the fire so they wouldn’t freeze. Lillya tossed and turned, then she heard​
​an owl outside the window. “It must be a ___________ owl just like the one that​
​lived in the tree outside my bedroom when I was a girl. This led her to think of her​
​father for he would imitate the owl when he came to say his good nights to her and​
​his hoot hoot hoot always made her laugh. “Some owls live to be ____ years old. I​
​wonder if the old owl is still alive? He might be the only one that remains.” She​
​smiled because the owl came to say goodbye then night they left on what her father​
​had named, “her adventure.” But the owl knew better and came out early that​
​evening and he lift his wing and hooted a fair thy well.​
​***​
​She was a master of disguise. If her years had taught her something, it was how to​
​look like someone else. However it wasn’t difficult these days as she barely​
​recognized herself. Hardship, time, and sadness had taken its toll. The wrinkles on​
​her face had dug in deeper and made a permanent home. She named the most​
​pronounced ones after female mythological characters. One she dubbed Athena, for​
​her intelligence and wisdom, another Demeter, for her power over food and plants​

​199​
​and her connection to the afterworld. The deepest crease became Aphrodite,​
​because it was her memories of love that sustained her. Accompanied by these​
​goddesses and great determination, she found the strength each day to lift her right​
​foot up and put it in front of the left. Then repeat the motion with the opposite leg​
​until it resembled walking.​
​Chapter 2​
​Lillya’s memories kept her going; that and the secret she shared with Natasha.​
​Similar to the town where Natasha was born, Perm, on the western side of the Ural​
​mountain range, their secret was well hidden in obvious plain site. It did not pass​
​Lillya that Kungur was near Perm, the town that Natasha had called home.​
​Lillya was determined to find Natasha once she and Anton got settled and she​
​wouldn’t stop until she knew that both she and their secret were safe. Then come​
​spring she would plant the sorts of vegetables that grow near the mountains and​

​200​
​come the warmth of summer she would shed her heartache and in the dirt she​
​would bury all but her own memories, even the ones of Anton that stopped her​
​from moving forward.​
​***​
​On this night like many she dreamed of memories of her friend.​
​***​
​Chapter​
​Lillya loved the night, for she was not limited by the physicality and realities of the​
​day. At night she could go wherever she wanted to go, and her subconscious was in​

​201​
​charge.  To her knowledge her conscious self had very little to say about it and​
​each night came with a surprise.​
​Tonight​
​***​
​The cold air in the cabin hit her nostrils like smelling salts and she began to​
​awaken.​
​Lillya started to blink her eyes but she wasn’t quite ready to get up. She pulled her​
​coat that had fallen off her during the night back on top of her. It was a cheap but​
​warm coat her husband had bought for her before they left from one of the carney’s​
​who in return received a gift more than ten times the coats monetary value in​
​return. The carney didn’t ask Anton, why? He simply knew not to turn his back on​
​a good deal.​
​Lillya looked out the window but it was still dark. Then she heard the rattling snore​
​of one of her roommates that sounded like a volcano erupting and realized it wasn’t​
​just the cold that had woken her up. It was nearer to sunrise, but she still had some​
​time before anyone would expect anything from her.​
​Lillya lay quietly on the sofa and shut her eyes once again. The erupting sounds of​
​the woman snoring represented inactivity in the cabin, and was actually welcome​
​once she had admitted to herself that sleep was over for the night, but it did not​

​202​
​mean she couldn’t remain where she was and let herself day dream and return to​
​her childhood.​
​***​
​Chapter 5​
​The path to Perm was a clear path unlike later years when it could not be found on​
​any of her maps. The directions she followed were simply the description Natasha​
​told her as teenager and much must have changed since then. Lillya wondered if​
​the shack where she was headed even still existed and what made her think that all​
​these years later Natasha would be waiting. Still as children Natasha made her​
​memorize the directions to her house, the one her great uncle on her mothers side​
​promised to leave her.​
​“Perm is on the western side of the Ural Mountain range on the Kama River. I’m​
​told its’ the prettiest river in our country. Our winters are very cold so be certain to​
​pack your warmest clothes but in the summer be ready for the heat for it gets very​
​hot. Now repeat after me. From the Opera House When you enter the town look for​
​the new opera house.  Everyone knows it. From there you will head toward the​

​203​
​mountain range and tell people you are looking for the home of Peter Palitov, the​
​miner. Each person you ask will get you alittle closer to his shack, which is located​
​a short distance from his cave. My uncle is a miner.” This will be our meeting​
​place should you ever need one. No one would ever suspect it or come to look for​
​you there.”​
​“Natasha you’re being silly.” Lillya said.​
​“You never know what life will bring you, if you are ever in danger you must go​
​there. I will be waiting for you. There is that unspeakable bond between us, I will​
​know.”​
​***​
​Sometimes Lillya had to pull herself from the past. One of the women who had​
​spent the night with her last night decided that she was going in the same direction​
​as Lillya. Lillya was not too pleased, but she didn’t own the forrest or the roads and​
​she couldn’t stop the woman from following her. The woman, whose name was​
​Trina would have her uses. She was a good shot and unlike Lillya.​
​Katrina couldn’t tell Lillya exactly where she was going and why, but the same​
​could be said for Lillya. So in silence they both headed toward the Ural Mountain​
​range lillya in front with Katrina not far behind her and for now that was good​
​enough.​

​204​
​Lilly didn’t have the slightest interest in befriending Katrina, the less she knew, the​
​better. Lillya didn’t trust her but then again she had come to trust no one so Katrina​
​was in the company, every one in Russia except Natasha.​
​Lillya tried to leave Katrina behind several times that first day. But Katrina was​
​nothing, if not cunning and after awhile Katrina began to chip away at some of the​
​stones that made up Lillya’s wall, besides as much as she didn’t want to admit it,​
​Lillya was lonely. She had always had her father, Natsha or Vvladimir.​
​“It’s easier traveling with Katrina,” she began to tell herself, but still she couldn’t​
​quite reconcile the uneasy feeling she had in the pit of her stomach. Everyone she​
​ever loved was dead or had vanished.  She thought about Natasha and wondered if​
​she was now the wealthy one between them.  Natasha’s status of maid would serve​
​her better than pampered dilatant who mingled with the nobles and whose great​
​aunt was close friends with a Dutchess and whose uncle had married a widowed​
​baroness. No in this new Russia Lillya’s past was something better to keep to​
​herself. She pretended to be Natasha only with a different name, and tried to​
​remember all that she learned about the lower classes who now ruled post​
​revolutionary Russia.  However Natasha was tutored like herself by the most​
​notably tutor’s of St. Petersburg. Her father had insisted.​
​***​

​205​
​Lillya Xena Akinsya Engelhardt was born to a family of great attention. Her father​
​Yuri had inherited the family land and houses and had turned them into a very​
​lucrative estate producing grains, collecting horses for breading, and a wine cellar​
​that captured the imagination of the most avid collectors. He married her mother​
​Alexandra when she was only 17 and he 20, long before any one, even Alexandra​
​had any inkling of her being sick.​
​Lillya who had a proper education, in her present predicament listened attentively​
​to Katrina’s speech trying silently to imitate each and every nuance, the way she​
​strung her phrases, what subjects or verbs she omitted. In her present disguise she​
​purposely spoke incorrect Russian and filled her speech with the words that only​
​peasants used. Just like them, Lillya couldn’t help who she was born too and she​
​did her best to appear as someone other than who she really was. It had become​
​another challenge for the notorious Lillya. “Learn to speak as horribly as you can,”​
​she told herself.​
​Katrina was not very forth coming herself. She spoke in half truths herself but​
​Lillya found it hard to fault her as her stories seemed to be more trutful than her​
​own.  Katrina said that her father worked in st Petersburg and she had been the​
​daughter of a blacksmith, working class. “Business is business,” Katrina said her​
​father used to say. “As long as they pay that customer is good enough for me.”​
​Then one day a red sympathizer showed up at the shop at the same time as a white​

​206​
​sympathizer and they got into an argument. Young boys and not very good shots​
​when they both drew  their guns she was later told, they both missed. However a​
​bullet hit the cast iron pot over her father’s fire, boounced off of the pot and went​
​directly through her father’s heart killing him on the spot. Both boys blamed it on​
​the other and got into a fist fight before realizing the trouble they could be in and​
​when they heard the policeman whistle they both went running in opposite​
​directiions. “No one wanted to take responsibility for the death of the beloved​
​blackshith,” Katrina said. “He was known to be on the side of the paying customer​
​and tried to serve both sides professionally with regard. He was well liked by all.”​
​Katrina finished, wanting to add the phrase, “even by your father,” but of course​
​she did not.​
​Lillya assumed an identity that closely resembled Nataha’s story. It was the one​
​that she knew best. She was familiar with maids for they had served her all of her​
​life.  She took her middle name and used it as her first and borrowed the sur name​
​of her favorite butler, Borkovich. Yes, Borkovich was much better than Engelhardt​
​for there was only one Engelhardt in St. Petersburg and he certainly didn’t work​
​the fields or clean out the barn or manage the horses. Lillya’s new identity, came​
​from months of planning with her husband and father. The evening she left her​
​child hood estate, her heart kept on beating, but every thing else seemed to have​
​gotten lost except for her memories.​

​207​
​Lillya smiled at the memory of AntonSr.’s disguise. They had been planning this​
​for months and after a while her handsome proud husband grew into the man that​
​would do what ever he had to to save her life. Up to this point the soldiers both red​
​and white had let them be. They weren’t really aristocrats or nobels. They just​
​associated with the upper reaches but he knew it wouldn’t last forever. Afterall the​
​Englehardt’s and the Vronsky’s had been very well known in St. Petersburg,​
​considering her family history, that she had been a notorious horsewoman, and she​
​married the famous tight rope walker Antonwho had inherited his families circus.​
​“No, too many people know who we are in St. Petersburg. I’m sorry my dear, we​
​have to leave.” Antonand her father broke the news to her one Sunday afternoon​
​while she was in the garden. It’s not as if she didn’t know this was coming, but​
​each day that they put it off was a good day as far as she was concerned. It had​
​been hard enough letting go of her son and never having had the opportunity to​
​meet his wife and family. “Now you want me to give up our home and my father​
​too,” she told Antonthat night. Though she had known for some time that they nno​
​longer had a choice.​
​They would have to look like different people. Lillya’s hair that had always been​
​neatly coiffed and folded close to her head she unpinned and wore it long and wild​

​208​
​as she had as a girl. Antongrew his hair long too and wore a beard down to his​
​chest and covered half of his head with a farmer’s hat.​
​In her satchel she carried several memories of the past; a letter from AntonJr.​
​mailed to Borkovic, and the journal her father had given her wrapped in an old​
​maids towel that was now just a rag but looked like the one Natasha used to use.​
​Better to think good thoughts Lillya reminded herself pulling herself back into the​
​present, and she took out a simple scarf Natasha had given to her as a birthday​
​present and let her hand roam the outside of the jour​
​because he wore it every day and it fell off of his head, as if just for her the day the​
​Red Army told him to get on his horse, that he was now one of them. They charged​
​their campsite one morning as AntonSr was making coffee. They called him old​
​man and they playfully kicked him. He didn’t speak much. “What do they want​
​with an old man?” Lillya wondered while hiding in the bushes. Finally they got​
​him to mount and it was then she understood. They shot him in the back. It must​

​209​
​have gone straight to his heart for he fell off his horse and hit the ground. Then the​
​soldier laughed.​
​“I could tell by his hands that he was one of them,” he told one squeamish boy.​
​“And besides” he continued, “his horse will serve us better than he would have. He​
​gave up his life for the cause. We each must serve as we can.”​
​Lillya stayed in the bushes until sunset and didn’t make a sound even as they​
​dragged her husband Vladimir’s body and threw it in the river.​
​Chapter 6​

​210​
​“Xenia,” Katrina laughed whe she was alone. “Oh how I and most every girl I​
​knew wanted to be her when she was young. She has no memory of me. I was just​
​a dirty child helping my father shoe her fathers horses in their barn.”​
​But Katrina remembered how Lillya would sparkle when she entered the barn.​
​Katrina knew Lillya wasn’t true royalty, but her family was close enough.​
​Sonja had heard rumors of Lillya’s affair and oh how she wished they were friends​
​and she could hear the story from the lips of Lillya, but for now she oulwd just​
​have to find happiness in kknowinf that the legend of that story was sleeping​
​beside her at night.​
