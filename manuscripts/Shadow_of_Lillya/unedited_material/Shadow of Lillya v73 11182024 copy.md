Prologue
Lillya shut her eyes and squeezed them tight. She imagined every
muscle and limb of her father’s favorite black stallion, and like she did as a
young girl, took off like Pegasus flying. The faster the horse went, the
clearer her past became, until it was as real as the struggles of her days. The
planets parted, the stars scattered, and a trail of her memories was left in the
shadow.

Chapter 1
The Winter Palace, Petrograd, January 1917
The sparkle from the jewels sewn into the gowns, draped around
necks, and held in place by bezels on the tiaras of the courtly ladies’ heads
was almost blinding. Giant crystal chandeliers swayed to the beat of the
music, while six-foot-tall marble vases filled with leaves of palm the size of
an African elephant’s ear stood guard, eavesdropping on every conversation.
A drunken frenzy inspired the orchestra, and they played faster and faster.
The loose limbs of the dancers on the ballroom floor looked like trees during
a hurricane, swaying up and down, gyrating in circles; then shaking like
dogs just pulled out of a pool of frozen water, the ladies and gentlemen
smiled with great satisfaction.
A count poured a pitcher of drink down the front of a duchess’ finely
stitched dress and then without any sort of inhibition he started to lick it.
Soon he was under her dress. She unfolded her fan as though she were
blushing in mock embarrassment. Then he popped his head out, seemingly
quite content with himself, and yelled to the crowd, “Do you know what
secret I found under there?”
The crowd shouted back, “No!”

6

The count smiled, then winked and said, “The Empress doesn’t go to
the hospital to help the soldiers. She goes because the Tsar no longer
satisfies her. She’s taken on a lover. I hear it’s one of the doctors, but who?
Who could it be?” He said again as if to challenge them. Then he grabbed
the drunk duchess’ hand and started dancing once again, knowing he had left
one word on the lips of all in attendance, “Who?”
***

“We don’t have to stay, my dear,” Anton whispered in Lillya’s ear.
“We’ve shown ourselves; we can go now.”

Curious as to the goings-on at court and the latest rumors being
spread, Lillya Xenia Englehardt Vronsky was not quite as anxious as her
husband to depart. “Dance with me,” she said. “You know everyone loves to
watch your graceful movements. “You are the best dancer in this ballroom,”
Lillya told her husband. “Besides we need to stay informed, now more than
ever,” she smiled through her teeth. She knew he knew she was right, but
she was also aware he had no stomach for such affairs. It pained him to
watch men and women he had once respected throw away their dignity so
easily as if it were an old scrap of food and simple to replace. However,
Lillya knew Anton Vronsky would not refuse her.

This past year Russia and St. Petersburg have been fighting for their
lives. Millions of soldiers and peasants have died, Lillya thought to herself,
and all the upper class can think about is overindulgence, intrigue and lies.

As if he were able to read her thoughts, Anton whispered, “When they
count their money and jewels tomorrow, I hope they tuck some of it away.”
“One of these days the tables could turn and where will they all be then?”
Anton did not say this to scare her. He simply wanted her to have a more
realistic idea of how the people outside of their class felt. What was their
level of aggravation and frustration and underneath that, anger? He had a
unique perspective, that of a common man. who had been brought into the
folds of high society. With one eye he read the minds of the aristocrats and
with his other eye the thoughts of the people who came to his circus and the
vendors from whom he bought food and trinkets almost every day on the
street.

Anton Vronsky was born the heir to the most famous Russian family
circus having come from a long line of high-wire walkers like his father,
Dmitri. Every day of his life from boyhood to the day he turned the circus
over to his own son, Vladimir, Anton mixed with and worked with the
people who filled his family’s bleachers. His circus made the crowds laugh
and scream. Yes, Anton felt certain he had a broader view of the temperature

8

of the world and such matters. He had been born into the upper class but
could still see the world through the people. With that in mind years earlier,
before the 1905 revolution and before he turned gray, Anton and Lillya
passed on their legacy, the Vronsky Family Circus, to their son Vladimir
who now lived in America with his wife and four daughters. For this, Anton
was glad, for he knew they were safe. Now, he had to focus on his wife and
that was enough.

The palace, Lillya noted, had recently adopted a frugal existence. Still,
the message they were trying to send seemed to have little to no effect on the
upper class, nor did it dictate their actions. The aristocrats, simply put, did
not want to see, feel, or accept the rage and growing anger of the people just
outside the palace doors or in the streets where they shopped, or in front of
their homes. Even though they could see a dark cloud was rising above
them, they continued to spend enormous sums of money frivolously while
the population was feeling the pangs of war and hunger, and the ball was just
one example.

Chapter 2
Yuri Engelhardt’s Townhouse, St. Petersburg, June 1877

“It’s mine,” Natasha said, and she grabbed the necklace right out of
Lillya’s hand.
“You know that’s not true. It was a gift from the Tsarina herself.
That’s what my grandmother told me.” However, Lillya’s grandmother was
really a great aunt who thought her sickly younger sister’s daughter would
need one and it was a role she had been training for her entire life. However
the old woman had procured the present, it didn’t matter. Lillya didn’t see
her grandmother often; she lived in Moscow and traveled to Europe
frequently with her husband from whom she had inherited her title and
royalty. Nonetheless, Lillya was sentimental about the old woman, more so
than most.
“It’s only because your mother is sick and the old one and I are your
only true friends.” For a second Natasha felt bad for saying something so
hurtful, but Lillya took Natasha’s guilt and used it against her and in this
moment of weakness she tackled Natasha and pinned her down on the floor.
After a few minutes they both got tired, and Natasha gave up.
“Okay, here it is.” Laughing, she handed Lillya the simple heart-
shaped ruby necklace. Remembering her place, she lifted Lillya’s long,

10

wavy hair and spun it into a bun on the top of her head, then added a deep
red rose from the garden that was conveniently in a vase nearby. Finally, she
locked the clasp of the necklace and let it fall down Lillya’s front where it
rested just above her chest.

“Now turn around so I can see how it shines almost as brightly as your
eyes. But it’s not nearly as beautiful as you,” said Natasha. Lillya just
smiled. She was used to these sorts of easy compliments from Natasha.

A maid walked through the door. “Will you please prepare a bath for
Lillya?” Natasha asked. Then she watched and waited until the bathwater
was poured, the maid knew that Natasha had almost full authority to ask for
whatever she liked when it came to Lillya. The maid delicately removed
Lillya’s clothes and helped her slip into the tub.

Lillya admired Natasha’s composure and self-assuredness. She never
brought up money or that by social class she was far above Natasha’s
station, for she liked and respected her too much to do something so cruel.
They had grown up together. Natasha was more like a sister than anything
else. Lillya couldn’t remember a time when she didn’t know Natasha. As far
as she was concerned, they had shared almost everything since birth. Still, as
they grew older, their difference in stature and how society would judge

11

them would become more apparent, for Natasha would remain the server
and Lillya the receiver.

Sometimes Natasha, as much as she loved Lillya, couldn’t stop herself
from getting a bit fed up with her situation, and she would find herself
becoming a bit manipulative. Natasha would search for a way to turn the
tables and on more than one occasion, she almost had Lillya convinced that
by being poor, Natasha was the wealthy one. Like the beautiful summer day
when Lillya’s father Yuri took Natasha shopping. Though she knew almost
everything that they would buy together would ultimately end up on Lillya,
Natasha recognized that Lillya would see it as a way for Natasha to spend
more time with her father, garnering his attention and praise. Being the same
size as Lillya worked for and against each of them depending upon their
mood and generosity of spirit. Realizing their similarities, when Yuri wanted
to buy something special for Lillya and he wanted to pick it out himself, he
would arrange for Natasha to have the day off. This way he wouldn’t have to
interrupt Lillya’s studies and Natasha got to spend an entire day by herself
with Lillya’s father. If he bought Lillya a new blouse, he purchased a smart-
looking scarf for Natasha along with a lovely belt so they each got to show
off something special. But for Natasha, the best gift she received on her days
spent with Yuri was the silent permission he gave her to converse freely,

12

show off her intelligence, wit and humor, and every smile that Yuri gave her
in return was more than enough reward for her. If she had been rich, she
would have been stuck at home like Lillya with the tutor, memorizing her
lessons instead of spending the day with the best seamstress in all of St.
Petersburg.
Natasha was beautiful like Lillya, and they shared a similar slant of
nose and a distinct dimple on their chins. Both girls could not believe their
luck to be so similar in both spirit and looks. They were close in age and
often pretended they were twins. Natasha was skilled like Lillya, but in
different ways. She had a photographic memory and could remember
everything Lillya had ever read to her, every classic, every poem. She could
recite what she had heard almost word for word. She excelled in history and
even learned to speak French just by sitting next to Lillya during her lessons.
French, the language of the aristocracy, slipped off her tongue easier than it
did her patron’s. Yuri’s Greek and Latin grammar books tempted her to read
Homer and the Roman poets in their ancient forms.
Still, Natasha worshipped Lillya and taking care of Lillya and being
her friend became Natasha’s raison d’être and how she got rewarded. Most
of the time she felt privileged to have been given such an important job. It
made her feel a step above the other maids, and she was.

13

Lillya’s father Yuri was a tall handsome man with prematurely gray
wavy hair and a mustache. This made him stand out from across a room and
look very regal and distinguished. He had almond-colored eyes that in a
certain light looked green, but not nearly as green as his daughter’s. His eyes
in the dark looked like cat eyes with candles lit behind them. However, what
made him special to Natasha was his ability to see what was special about
her, and the way he quietly encouraged her by allowing her to sit in on
Lillya’s tutoring sessions and make certain she was not disturbed. Lillya
could have objected, but she enjoyed the company and later she had
someone to discuss that day’s lesson with who could remember it word for
word.

Lillya stood up in the tub. The maid was waiting with a towel to dry
her off and prepare her for evening supper. She undid her bun, took out the
flower Natasha had put in her hair and shook her big mane. It was almost as
thick as a horse’s tail. Droplets splattered across the room, leaving pools of
water on the floor.

Chapter 3
Yuri Englehardt’s estate outside Petrograd, February 1918

Lillya and Anton lived with Lillya’s father, Yuri, on a large estate
south of St. Petersburg, west of the Catherine Palace in Tsarskoye Selo, the
Tsar’s Village.

The Englehardt’s main house had Frankish influences with a nearby
manor house and a chapel. Tree-lined lanes, corrals and lush open fields
allowed Lillya and Anton ample space to ride. There were fruit and
vegetable greenhouses and a flower garden.

It seemed a natural fit. Yuri loved good alcohol, fine food and horses.
He valued athleticism and people who did the best that they could at
whatever it was that sparked their passion. He had enjoyed watching his
young grandson Vladimir, as he learned all the feats and skills he would
need to lead the family’s circus, his destiny. Sometimes, this made Yuri
wonder what they really thought about his estate and all that had come with
it by birth. But he genuinely enjoyed the world that his daughter had become
a part of, and on afternoons when he had nothing else to do, he would visit
the Vronsky Family Circus, sit in the bleachers, and watch the dancing bears
and elephants and tigers all learn new tricks, and he was fascinated. “It takes
so much more than skill,” he said to his daughter Lillya. “It would take me a

15

lifetime of learning patience to do what they do. I so admire the talents your
son is inheriting.”

In later years, long after Lillya and Anton stitched a life together, as
much as Yuri had enjoyed Anton’s circus, Anton surprised himself by
adjusting to a life of leisure so easily.

Sometimes, though, Lillya acknowledged that the world around her
was crumbling, especially in regard to Russia, her home country, the country
she loved with all her heart. The revolution had begun last February with the
strikes and food shortages, followed by demonstrations and finally the
unthinkable - the mutiny of the Imperial Guard.

It wasn’t long before news began to trickle in about the arrests of
friends, other wealthy aristocrats, some, who just like Lillya and Anton, had
attended the ball a year past. The uncertainty of her future began to haunt
her, and she found herself staying up late into the night trying to wash the
nightmares away. She remembered each one and could repeat them at will
with detail like fine needlework. She began to sew them together. In her
nightmare, she saw a garbage cart and an old man who picked up what was
left behind and would soon pass it on to a peasant who was poorer than
himself. Fear ran through her body like nerves out of control. She found
herself face down in mud, unable to come up for air and she thought she

16

would drown. Then a man with a familiar demeanor wrapped his arms
around her and told her not to worry because he would save her. Then she
would wake up gasping for breath. But who was he and why would he save
her?

Which army would eventually come to get them? Would it be the
Reds or the Whites that would ultimately come and take them away? She
tried to keep her immense fear to herself and would remind herself that fear
only breeds more fear. Though news continued to find its way to their door,
none of it was good.

The Reds wasted no time in seizing power and property from the
wealthy. Every few days someone they knew vanished, and soon Lillya and
Anton were forced to face the truth. “St. Petersburg, or should I say
Petrograd has gotten too dangerous for people like us,” Anton finally told his
wife. “We can’t hold off any longer.”

Lillya was in agreement. Anton was sympathetic to the plight of the
common people, but he was driven most of all by his duty to protect her and
their family. Many of Lillya and Anton’s aristocratic friends were forced at
gunpoint to clean toilets or dig graves while some had simply disappeared.
Had they been captured, or had they escaped?

17

Lillya’s family was very high up the aristocratic ladder, but they were
all well-liked in the community and they each had a special talent that could
not be replicated. But she knew, in her heart, that had she not been married
to Anton she would have met a horrible fate.

Weeks before their departure, her father and Anton planned the best
method and route of escape from St. Petersburg, the one least likely to have
them identified and detained. Of course, travel by sea, rail or motorized
vehicle was out of the question. Their only option was by horse.

“It’s good that you could see so far ahead, Yuri,” Anton said after
Yuri reviewed his idea of sending Lillya and Anton off to their cousin
Michael in distant Perm province due to the unspoken favors Michael owed
him. “He’s a good man, but one needs a little more than goodness during
these times to get someone to risk their life.”

So, it was decided and Lillya had her own reasons to follow suit.
Besides her father, Anton loved her more than anyone and both would give
their own lives to save her, so she had no reason not to trust their plan.

Until that day, though, Lillya decided to appreciate every minute and
every pleasure that she had been afforded during her life; besides, riding her
favorite stallion to take her mind off what was about to happen seemed like a
smart thing to do.

18

“Am I grayer than I was last week?” she asked her husband. They all
seemed to grow older in that short period of time, more than she had
imagined possible. As they came up with the details of their plan, it slowly
dawned on Lillya that her father would stay behind, but what could he do to
protect himself and their beloved home when the Bolsheviks came to seize
them?

19

Chapter 4
Yuri’s estate, June 1880
Lillya Xenia Akinsya Engelhardt was born to a family of great
attention. Peter the Great granted her ancestors property and serfs in 1714 as
reward for their service in the war against Sweden that won for Russia the
swamp land St. Petersburg was built upon. Her father Yuri inherited some of
the family land and turned it into a very lucrative estate; producing grains,
collecting horses for breeding and a wine cellar that captured the
imagination of the most avid collectors. He married her mother Angelika
when she was only 17 and he 20, long before anyone, even Angelika, had
any inkling of her being sick.
Lillya’s mother had been ill as long as Lillya could remember, though
once in a while the doctors would let her come home. When they did,
everyone would be on pins and needles waiting for the moment the
symptoms of her anxiety would begin again. She would shake and sweat just
a little bit and that would last for several days. The nurses would wipe her
brow and try to keep her comfortable and calm her down with smelling salts
and herbs. By the fourth night they would wrap her tightly in a blanket to
keep her arms pinned so she couldn’t hurt herself. Lillya would toss and turn
on those nights. She would sing herself to sleep focusing on the heart-shaped

20

mole on her back while trying to think of happy songs, praying they would
bring about a good outcome. Natasha waited until she could stand it no
more. They were both aware of what would happen next. Natasha would
pull her covers down and quietly make her way to Lillya’s bed, Lillya would
open her blanket and let Natasha in and in the morning they would awake
with their arms wrapped around the other.
Lillya’s mother, Angelika, wouldn’t shout or cry, even though
sometimes they wrapped her so tightly she could barely breathe. Where she
was going would be more comfortable for her and bring her one step closer
to her life’s purpose; to be god’s messenger as was written in her name, but
Lillya kept on wondering, messenger of what?
In the middle of the night, Natasha and Lillya would hear the carriage
wheels approaching and the clop, clop of the horses’ hoofs as they got
nearer. It was impossible to interpret the commotion that was taking place,
the low humming mumbles of her father’s and the doctors’ voices. A groggy
reply from her mother, who earlier had been given something they called
opium. Lillya only knew that it was strong and made her mother agreeable
and sleepy. Angelika’s doctor, through his mustache and beard, would
explain to her father what he already knew. They would be taking her to the

21

spa in Odessa where she could rest, and hopefully get better and one day
return to the family for good.
The entire process usually only took two or three months. At first
everything would be wonderful, and Lillya would get very excited and
almost believe she might have a mother. But even by the age of five or six,
the more it happened, and it did, again and again, Lillya began to recognize
the signs. She could read her mother’s body language.
The headaches would start, then she would join the family only for
lunch, then she would lock herself in her room for the rest of the day. Soon
she wouldn’t retreat from her bedroom at all, nor receive any visitors,
including Lillya. Then, almost like clockwork, the sweating and shaking
would begin and the following day Natasha would hand Lillya a note when
she opened her eyes, but the flowers next to her bed told Lillya all that the
note would say. Natasha stood ready with Lillya’s robe and slippers and
together they would enter her mother’s bedroom. The bed would be made as
if no one had ever been there, and Lillya would defend her mother’s actions
by repeating to Natasha what she had heard all her life: her mother Angelika
had a special job and she was off being a messenger for God, and then Lillya
would think, for what? For whom?

22

Lillya would ask her Grandmama, when she saw her and they were
alone, where her mother had really gone. Grandmama would say, “She’s
with the doctors back at the hospital trying to get better for you.” At least
that was a partial truth. But then one morning her Grandmama came to their
house dressed head to toe in black. Lillya did not have to ask. Her father, not
grasping Lillya’s comprehension of the situation, told her that her mother
decided to visit God during the night and she found it so peaceful and
delightful that she missed the one train back home. Flowers came and filled
the house and Lillya laid some on her mother’s grave as she stood bravely
next to her father with Natasha holding her hand. Later her Grandmama
handed her a note. I found this in your mother’s room. It simply said, “Tell
my daughter to have a good life. We will see each other again when the
angels call for her many years from now.” Years later Lillya waited for her
mother in the dark, but she never came.
To take out her frustration Lillya rode. Every day she took out one of
her father’s horses and she rode them hard, and day by day she honed her
talent. The family trainer had once tried to teach her, but Lillya ignored him,
instead she walked among the horses in the corral, waiting for the curious to
approach her. Then she would speak softly to them, and they would let her
climb aboard, unsaddled, and she mastered them like a Mongol or a Cossack

23

child. She soon earned a reputation as a daring horsewoman. Her father
closed his eyes as his young daughter practiced gymnastics on her horse.
***
Natasha’s mother, Sonya Palitov, was a housekeeper at a nearby
estate. They moved to St. Petersburg from Perm when Natasha was barely
four. She visited her mother every Sunday. A woman would come from the
estate and would dress her in the clothes that Yuri’s personal maid laid out
for her, but when she arrived where her mother worked, no matter how
beautifully she was dressed, she would be sent to the back door where her
mother would greet her. She had been instructed to never enter the main
entrance.
Although she loved her mother, it became her least favorite day of the
week, except for one thing, Natasha had something that Lillya did not, a
mother.
Natasha, too, had some questions left unanswered, like “Who is my
father and why was my beautiful, wonderful mother born into the station of
a servant?”
Natasha tried not to think too much about what the future would
bring. She believed she was living her best life now, and Lillya was

24

unwilling to admit that eventually they would be forced by society to go
their separate ways and develop separate lives.
***
Yuri’s Townhouse, March 1881

Yuri came into Lillya’s bedroom to awaken her himself. He had been
crying and she had not seen him look like this since her mother died. He sat
on the edge of her bed to deliver sad news. Tsar Alexander II had been
assassinated in his carriage by a terrorist with a bomb. The streets of St.
Petersburg were by now filled with soldiers and police. It was not a time to
go out playing. They would stay in their home until announcements were
made about the funeral and the succession.

At some point they would be called upon to participate but for now
they needed to stay inside to pray for Russia and grieve for the Tsar and his
family. The servants went about their duties without cheer or smiles.
Natasha came to Lillya’s room and immediately hugged her.

In the days that followed, Yuri and Lillya looked at photographs that
had been taken of him with the Tsar including one that included her mother
and herself as a very small child.
The day of the funeral, Lillya was dressed in black and ready to leave
with her family but because this all reminded her too much of her mother’s

25

funeral, she could not stop weeping and it was decided that she should stay
at home. She refused to remove her black dress and wanted to spend the day
reading and singing songs with Natasha. Every funeral reminded her of her
mother’s funeral, and they were unbearable for her. Just dressing up in black
gave her chills and she wouldn’t keep a black dress in her closets.
But before the carriages departed, Natasha urgently prevailed upon
her to get over her fears and attend to give comfort to her her childhood
playmate, Nicki the new Tsarevitch who was himself only thirteen. At the
gravesite, Nicki saw how tearful she was and hugged her, telling her and her
family that she could be excused from the remainder of the service. He was
grateful for her attendance, and she had given him courage to stay because
he wanted to do exactly what she was doing. Her governess was then
instructed to take Lillya away to wait in the carriage.

26

Chapter 5
Yuri’s estate, March 1918

“I insist! Our old workhorse, Sophie, is exactly the kind of horse I will
need, and she won’t attract attention. Sophie and Timur are my choices and
Anton can choose a horse to pull our cart. That’s enough. Any more and
we’ll have thieves outside our campfire waiting for the fire to grow dim so
they can jump in and take what is ours.”
They had been planning this for weeks and after a while her
handsome, proud husband grew into the man that would do whatever he had
to do to save her life. Yuri and Anton poured over maps, deciding upon a
southern route through Nizhny Novgorod and Kazan and then continuing
eastward to reach Kungur. This route passed near larger towns and provided
opportunities for rest and resupply. They would have the cart loaded with
plenty of beets, potatoes, borscht and dried meats that they could eat along
the way as well as a few cases of lower grade vodka to drink or barter –
Yuri’s best vodka would only arouse suspicion about who they were and
how they got it.
Up to this point the soldiers, both Red and White, had let them be. But
they knew it wouldn’t last forever. After all, the Englehardt’s and the
Vronsky’s had been very well known in St. Petersburg. Lillya had been a

27

notorious horsewoman, and she’d married the famous tightrope walker
Anton who had inherited his family’s circus.
It had been hard enough letting go of her son and never getting to
meet his wife and family. “Now must we give up our home and my father,
too?” she asked Anton the night before they left but she knew they had no
choice.
They would have to look like different people. Lillya’s hair, that had
always been neatly coiffed and folded close to her head, she unpinned and
wore long and wild as she had as a girl. Anton grew his hair long too and
wore a beard down to his chest and covered half of his head with a farmer’s
hat.
In her satchel, she carried a letter from Anton mailed to a fictitious
person named Borkovic to use as an alternate form of identity.
Better to think good thoughts, Lillya observed, and pulling herself
back into the present, she took out a simple scarf Natasha had given to her as
a birthday present.
The day of their parting came like any other. The sun rose, they ate
their breakfast together and joked as if they would be doing the same
tomorrow. But as the hour of their departure neared, their emotions began to
take over.

28

Lillya heard her father searching through his favorite room. “Not this
one,” and he broke the bottle. She knew better than to join him at this
moment. He had a right to release his feelings in private. Then minutes later
she heard her father express a very satisfied, “Yes.” She quickly moved
away from the door. She didn’t want her father to know she had been
listening.
“We’re going to have a little something before I send you off,” he said
when he climbed back up the stairs. “Can’t let you go without warming you
up a bit first. Tell that husband of yours to come inside.”
When Lillya and Anton entered her father’s study, he was opening an
ungodly expensive bottle of Massandra Sherry that had once been a part of
the Tsar’s wine collection. Uncorking it like the expert he was, he poured
three glasses. He refused to make a toast, for there would be no solemn
goodbye, instead he lit his pipe and sat back in his old leather chair enjoying
the smell of his tobacco while he made a gurgling sound imploring his
tongue to fall into place and his lungs to pull in just the right amount of air to
kidnap the scent of the wine’s bouquet before taking a full sip. Without
saying a word, they were all aware of the placement of the sun. They would
depart just before sunset, the time of least recognition.

29

Anton went outside to check on the horses. Lillya had passed on the
stallion and her favorite mare and told her solid Orlov Trotters that they
would soon be leading the way. She was about to kiss her father when he
touched her shoulder and stopped her. “I have something to give you, Lillya.
I should have done this years ago, but I didn’t have the courage. It’s
wrapped in a small, ordinary maid’s towel so if a thief approaches you,
they’ll think it holds no value. Inside are answers to the many questions I
know still linger. Put it someplace safe and keep it to yourself.”
Lillya lifted one corner of the package to see what was inside. It was
her father’s journal. “Some of the pages are soiled, but it’s all that you’ll
need,” he told Lillya. “Now go. Finish getting yourself ready. You are not a
young girl anymore, and don’t worry about your old Papa. He’s had a good
life and more than any other person, it was you who brought me joy, and that
son of yours, oh how I miss him.” Anton walked back in the house and her
father kissed him on the cheek and grasped his hands.
“Take care of my daughter as you always have. You will be protected
in the town of Kungur. It is near the city of Perm. When things have settled
down, you will find some amusement there.”
Perm? I wonder if Natasha is there now. Lillya reflected silently.

30

“You will go to the lower part of the town,” her father continued. “On
Kittarskaya Street is the Uspenskaya Church. My cousin Michael is friends
with the priest,” he said, then glanced at Lillya to make certain she was
listening. “He is expecting you, and the priest and his church have received
large donations for this service. The church has places where you and Lillya
will be able to hide in safety. Michael has many trustworthy friends.
Besides, in doing this he is paying back an old debt.”
“Thank you, Papa. I promise we won’t forget. I love you.”
Staying behind was surely a death sentence, but he had decided there
was not a better nor more fitting place for him to die. He had never needed
such a big house nor so much property. It had been passed down to him as
all property got passed down to the firstborn male. It was all he had ever
known and now he had a lifetime of memories and was too old and formed
in his habits to start anew. He loved his estate, the wine and the horses and
he had always taken good care of the families who lived with them. There
would be no goodbyes. Instead, two short French phrases rolled off his
tongue later that day: “À la prochaine fois. Je t'embrasse très fort1.” Then he
did his best to smile.

1 Until next time, I bid you farewell.

31

However, that was the day everything changed. Lillya could feel her
father’s eyes on her back, but she did not turn around. What she hoped
would only be months turned into years, and her autumn-like figure had no
choice but to march into winter just as she did.

32

Chapter 6
Yuri’s estate, May 1884
Riding with arms stretched out wide, the wind on her face, she spoke
softly to her horse, Pluto Gaetano, a gift from the Tsar, her cheeks blushed
bright red. She couldn’t contain her excitement, and she howled to the
chipmunks, rabbits, squirrels, and all the animals of the forest. Lillya had
grown tired of being so secretive. She wanted the world to know what they
had accomplished.
Her horse prepared himself. He knew what was coming and he made
an effort to keep an even, steady pace. He imitated her breath as if they were
a part of one another. Then she stood upright on the horse's back and
counted to eight, nine, ten. When she reached the number ten she came back
down again. Rocking steadily forward, she was grinning from ear to ear.
“Good boy,” she said to the horse as she released the pressure in her
knees. They came to a slow steady trot, then she nestled her head into his
neck, feeling all of his muscles. “I'm so proud of you Pluto! I have an apple
in my pocket. I brought it especially for you.” Then she gave him a hug.
Suddenly she got the feeling that they were being watched as if a hunter was
looking at its prey.

33

“Good boy,” she said softly to her horse again. “We’re not alone,” she
mumbled under her breath, but instead of being frightened, she suddenly
became very bold as if it were a statement of herself.
“Who are you and why are you in my woods? I demand you announce
yourself!” There was not a sound except for some rustling in the bushes.
Then she caught a glimpse of a young boy who she believed worked close
by. “Not again,” she said just loud enough for him to hear.
This was the third time the boy had come to watch her ride. He had to
have woken up very early to do so as she rode every morning between eight
and nine. She decided he must be very shy otherwise he’d have introduced
himself, so she shouldn’t punish him too badly. Besides, she had recently
shared her new trick with her father.
Lillya didn’t get too close, Natasha said he was smitten by her
command of horses and also her horse. “You are well beyond average in
every way,” Natasha said. “you will mesmerize many others, I just know it!”
“Mesmerize,” Lillya liked that word.
Then she became a bit angry. He knew who she was, but he was still a
mystery to her.

34

Lillya circled the boy with her horse. The boy followed her with his
eyes as if she were a crystal ball spinning in circles as fast as she could. Still,
he did not run, he just seemingly grew dizzy. He was frozen.
“Next time plan on introducing yourself,” she yelled to the boy and
then she galloped off in the direction of home. “Who is this boy and what
does he want?” Then she smiled, realizing she enjoyed the mystery.
Lillya began humming to herself. She liked to hum. She liked the way
it felt. The vibrations massaged her insides which always got a little jumbled
up between her equestrian tricks and the feelings she was having for a boy
she had never met. It also helped to pass the time and before she knew it,
Lillya was back at her father’s stable, and the stable boy had taken hold of
the reins of the magnificent stallion.
Lillya couldn’t get the image of the boy in the woods out of her mind.
“Maybe he won’t come again,” she thought. Then she found herself hoping
she was wrong. As much as he angered her, he intrigued her twice that
amount.
She excelled above all the other girls her age in her riding ability, but
she had one thing that she kept as a secret that was an embarrassment to her.
She had a single large mole in the middle of her back that was shaped like a
heart. Lillya felt as if she had been marked when it came to love, but she

35

didn’t know for what or why. When she was a child, she and Natasha would
try to rub the mole away, but as she grew older, she had to come to terms
with the fact it wasn’t going away. “Yes, God has a plan for me,” she would
say to Natasha, the only person who knew. “This way he will know for
certain how to find me when he is ready and be certain I was the one.”
Lillya never met anyone besides Natasha who could replicate her
spirit. Natasha was proud and self-confident, but it was hard for her, being
so smart, to be stuck in a lower station in life. Born the daughter of a maid,
she couldn’t help but feel that she had been misplaced. Natasha’s quick wit
was apparent to anyone who met her, and it seemed impossible for her to
keep it entirely to herself. She recognized how lucky she was to have been
placed in Yuri’s household on this beautiful estate and to have become
Lillya’s best friend.
Her father Yuri was very generous, and on some deep level, Lillya
saw that he felt bad for Natasha and his compassion made her love him
more. He secretly left books under her pillow. Each time Natasha found a
new book she would devour it, staying up late at night until her eyes got
weary and she could no longer lift her head.
Thinking about her station in life only got her depressed so she
focused on other things, like pleasing Lillya and Yuri.

36

Lillya and Natasha became inseparable, and Natasha hoped it would
never end. Lillya, not one to look too far down the road, did not see that life
would eventually take them down different paths. Though Lillya’s father
Yuri knew that day would come, he reconciled himself to it by knowing that
in the meantime he was doing something good. He gave Natasha a good
home where she could be educated, challenged, and cared for, and he gave
his daughter a best friend and confidante, who she could love and trust.

37

Chapter 7
Road from St. Petersburg to Kungur, April1918
Keeping a secret is much harder to do when your audience is already
mistrusting. No one seemed to tell the truth. The trick was to be able to sense
the true from the false and learn to interpret an ever-changing code. The
White Army was made up mostly of Russia’s armed forces, members of the
upper classes, and soldiers from other nations. They didn’t like one another,
and they certainly weren’t unified. At least that is what Anton told Lillya.
But then again, Lillya thought, even my father was not completely
truthful until he handed me his journal. Or one could say he told the truth
with great omissions. This leather-bound book would speak more intimately
to Lillya in her father’s voice, than he had his whole life. Their fire’s flames
drew her into herself and got her thinking of her family’s sumptuous
townhouse on Shvedskiy Lane in the Golden Triangle district with its
gigantic fireplace. She wondered if those striking flames from so many years
prior were trying to tell her something and she wasn’t listening.
Then a spark from the fire made a loud crackling sound and shook her
back to the present. In the distance, she could hear horses galloping and
wondered if they were White or Red, or perhaps Czech? The army had been

38

fighting a foreign war on the German front, but now it found itself in a civil
war and there were famous regiments on both sides of the struggle.
Her ears followed the sound of the riders while her mind spun nervous
ideas. Maybe they are just like us, people on the run and hiding. Still, she
thought, I’ll hold my breath until they pass.
The cruelty of both sides had become well-known. Lillya knew that
their lives could easily depend upon the whimsy of a handful of soldiers.
And their fate would be decided by what kind of night or day these soldiers
had had. If the soldiers had had a good day, they might only take your food
and horses. On a bad day, they would also shoot you and not think twice.
Lillya thought about the journal her father had given to her. She was
anxious to read it. She was having a hard time falling asleep. The abandoned
cabin they were in was cold and dark. Still, she and Anton were grateful for
the cover from the wind. Lillya watched Anton’s stomach rising up and
down and every once in a while, he would make a funny little squeaking
sound through his nostrils.
Trying not to make any noise while making sure he was asleep, she
put his handkerchief lightly over his nose to lessen the sound and quietly
slipped her thumb and her index finger into the bag that carried her

39

belongings, including now her father’s journal, hoping to pull out just a little
corner of truth before she said goodnight to the moon and stars.
“Just a few words and I’ll put it right back,” she said as if she were
bargaining with God. Anton’s snoring became much deeper and since he
was a light sleeper she didn’t want to wake him, nor did she want him to
catch her reading a journal he knew nothing about. Her father had asked her
to keep it to herself and that’s what she intended to do.
Afraid to pull it completely out of her bag, Lillya squinted, trying to
make out one word at a time, but the sky was too dark. She squinted until
her eyes hurt and the chill from being outside her covers overrode her
curiosity. She would wait. Then, just as she was about to close the journal,
the name Michael popped out.
Anton’s legs were getting restless and soon his eyes would open.
Lillya began to shake. She wasn’t certain if it was the fear of being caught or
the thought of betraying her father, or if she had just chilled herself to the
bone. Quickly, she wrapped the journal back into the maid’s towel and threw
it in her satchel.
Anton shook his right leg and sat up. “What are you doing up, my
dear? You’re going to need to be rested, we have a long ride ahead of us.”
Seeing she was shaking, he came over with another blanket, bent down and

40

gave her a kiss. She thanked him and closed her eyes. The journal will be
there in the morning, she told herself. Maybe if I keep my eyes closed long
enough, I will really fall asleep. But before she knew it, small rays of
sunlight had found their way into the cabin. Soon they would be planning
their day.
The clop, clop sound of the horses she had been focusing on earlier
was now in the distance. Anton having covered the fire with a big pot,
hoping not to completely suffocate it, gave her a cup of coffee. It was resting
by her feet that were wrapped in her blanket as she tried to keep warm.
Anton, knowing how tired his wife had become, more from the
emotional stress than the physical, felt a need to push Lillya a bit with the
inspiration of something that would be tangible. “In a few weeks time the
weather will begin to warm, flowers will bloom, and the air will fill with
birds.” Lillya laughed, “And the ice will melt, and the roads will turn to
mud.”
He could tell by the look on her face he was going to have to pull out
all the circus tricks he carried to get her moving again and to give up her
blanket for the cold and unknown.

41

Anton appealed to Lillya’s adventurous spirit. “I can almost smell the
scent of Kungur leather in the distance.” Anton, for the sake of his wife,
wore a positive playful face.
“Yes,” said Lillya, doing her best to let her husband know that she
hadn’t lost her humor, looked at her husband and said in a dry voice with a
sly grin, “We’re going to Kungur,” then she paused for several seconds, put
on a smile, and said, “Isn’t that the last stop before nowhere?”
Anton and Lillya burst out in laughter and Lillya, who couldn’t stop
herself from being satirical added, “I guess it’s not so bad. At least we’ll be
on the west side of the mountain range. Think of our Tsar and his family;
they’re on the Eastern side in Siberia with five million hectares of nothing
but isolation, ice and snow. We should be grateful. We’ll be near Perm
where there’s a decent opera, and I hear they grow watermelon in the
summer,” she said in an almost joyful voice while under her breath she was
thinking, maybe Natasha will be there.
“Perm Province is large,” Anton recited. “Remember we will be at the
mercy of others. This is not a vacation.”
Lillya had never been to Siberia, but all Russians had heard stories of
the place and at times found ways to romanticize the rough life it took to
survive with its unique qualities, but mostly they shuddered with fear at the

42

thought of being forced to live there. Some had compared it to a batch of
stew where a little of everything was thrown in until it became something
new. European prisoners of war mixed with native aboriginal tribesmen, and
they sometimes spiced the pot by throwing in a Russian Jew or political
exile. Then there was the Trans-Siberian Railway, workers from around the
world populated that path for over 15 years while they built it.
For a few minutes Lillya had given herself permission to daydream.
Every once in a while, as Anton spoke, she caught a glimpse of her old self.
The teenage girl who galloped through the woods like a streak of lightning
while standing upright on the back of Pluto Gaetano, the black Orlov-
Rostopchin from Tsar Alexander III’s stable.
She and Anton had been on edge long before they had left Petrograd,
a name she couldn’t get used to, the new name of her beloved St. Petersburg.
She had forgotten what it was like to have no reason to hide and oh how
Anton hated being the one holding the kite string, adjusting how far away
Lillya could drift before she needed to be pulled back in and to the ground.
He had married a free spirit and that was the woman Lillya liked and the one
that he loved.

43

Chapter 8
Yuri’s estate, January 1886

Petra and Dmitri Vronsky from the famous Vronsky Family Circus
were coming to their home to show her father a young Arabian mare they
thought would be good for breeding. “They’ll be staying for supper,” her
father announced earlier.

Lillya had never been to the circus, and she was curious. She had been
brought up to believe that you only went to the circus if you had been invited
to watch the performers at the palace of the Tsar. It was beneath them, but
recently her father had changed his mind. As he got to know Dmitri better,
he found himself growing fonder of the man who was a master on the
tightrope and a wizard when it came to horses.

Dmitri was well educated and very clever, besides being strong and
brave. All qualities Yuri admired, he enjoyed Dmitri’s dry wit and sense of
humor. “The man says what he thinks and doesn’t stop himself from
expressing what he really feels. Most men are afraid of what other men
might think, but this makes him courageous in my eyes.”

Lillya started talking excitedly while the maid was helping her dress.
“Papa says when Mr. Vronsky touches a horse something magical happens.

44

He knows which ones to choose. It’s as if they speak to him,” she told
Natasha.

Natasha was fumbling through Lillya’s drawers.

“What are you looking for?” she asked.

“Got it!” and Natasha pulled out a simple gold necklace to
complement Lillya’s ruby, along with a matching bracelet.

“Now that’s perfect,” she said, feeling quite satisfied with herself.
“They’ll be here within the hour, we must hurry.”

A blue-green gown with gold threads was waiting on Lillya’s bed, but
first they had to fix her hair. “If you move any slower, they’ll find someone
to replace me and then what would you do?” Natasha teasingly barked.

“Papa would never replace you. I couldn’t live without your
company,” Lillya replied. “I’d have to go on a hunger strike.”
Natasha smiled because she knew Lillya was telling the truth.
Looking out the window Lillya saw the Vronskys coming up to the house
from the stables. “Papas got a smile on his face. He must have liked what he
saw. Looks like he decided she’s the one.”

Lillya quickly walked down the stairs into the parlor where the
Vronskys and her father had just been poured drinks and the help was
serving caviar. Yuri seemed to be quite taken by the couple. He rarely

45

grinned and only showed his poker face to strangers, but on this occasion, he
could barely fit all the happiness he felt inside himself.

Petra’s petite figure was dressed in a bold royal blue and her pitch-
black shiny hair was pulled back in a perfect twist. Her smile, so bright and
warm, could disarm any soldier it came face to face with. Any man
determined to do battle with her would surely succumb to her radiance
alone. Yet Lillya noticed Petra was relaxed and seemed to not notice her
effect on men. She would throw her head back and laugh as if she were the
only one in the room. She was cheerful and kind and clearly loved her life
and her husband most of all.

“Our daughter Lillya is the horsewoman of our family. Oh, how she is
going to love your horse! Lillya, this is Mr. and Mrs. Vronsky from the
famed Vronsky Family Circus,” Yuri said.

“Your father has told us much about you,” Mr. Vronsky replied. “He
said that you can already ride standing up. That says much about your
character.”

“I find if one is balanced, not afraid and speaks kindly to a horse she
knows quite well, that almost anything is possible,” Lillya replied. “That is
with practice, of course.”

46

“I must agree,” Petra Vronsky replied. “I have seen tricks on horses
that would stump a magician.” Lillya instantly liked her.

A butler called them in for supper. Lillya caught a glimpse of Natasha
at the top of the stairs and was happy she was listening in. She wished that
she could call Natasha down to join them, but they both knew their place.
She would have to share the evening with her later.

Biting into a Cornish game hen, she admired their cook’s ability to
add just the right amount of paprika on top of it and dole out to each person
a perfect serving size of rosemary potatoes. Lillya soon forgot about
Natasha, savoring each morsel of food and especially the conversation.
She let her father take the lead, remembering they had company, for it might
have sounded rude for her to ask the questions she wanted to know the
answers to immediately.

Finally, they got around to the subject Lillya was most interested in
hearing about, the circus. She was besotted by a story Dmitri told about their
tigers Midnight and Satin. They were recently given to the Vronskys by a
Prince from India after he saw their circus perform for the Tsar and his
children on the lawn of the Winter Palace. Dmitri said, “I was rehearsing one
afternoon when all of a sudden, I heard a tremendous amount of commotion
outside. I stopped to see what was happening and when I went out front

47

there were five royal carriages and a hand-painted, gilded cage with the
names Midnight and Satin painted on it. By now Petra was outside next to
me.”

“Yes,” Petra agreed.

“Holding Petra’s hand, I inched in closer. A man in formal Indian
dress handed me a letter and said, ‘This is a gift from the prince. You must
have made quite an impression.’

“Inside the gilded cage were two tiger kittens, playing with a big ball
of yarn. The representative continued to say that they had been abandoned
on the prince’s estate and that the prince himself had personally nursed them
back to health. So, what was I to do,” Dmitri said, “but to graciously accept
them?”

“I used to go inside their cage and play with them until they got too
big,” Petra said. Lillya’s ears perked up even more when Petra mentioned
they had a son who walked the high-wire and was also a notable horseman.
She got chills just thinking of anyone walking across a wire fifty feet up in
the air, for only Natasha knew that Lillya became afraid of heights if there
was not something solid between her and the ground. A horse was solid, so
she had no problem standing up while galloping on a rosin-back. “Anyone

48

can do what I do if they want to, but to walk a wire, why that is
magnificent.”

Petra could see Lillya was mesmerized by the glint in her eyes that
became similar to the accepting look in her father’s eyes. Neither of them
could hide their fascination.

Later that night when she shared the events of the evening with
Natasha, she did not fail to mention, “Oh, and did I tell you, his mother told
me they have a son who walks the high wire?”

“I wonder why they made no offer of an introduction. They didn’t
even tell me his name. They simply said he was talented and had a playful
sort of personality. They should know that I’m old enough to meet their son”
Lillya went on. “Thank goodness for Papa though. By the end of the
evening, he decided to put his stallion Phosphorous with their mare Pepper.
Then he promised the Vronskys that we would attend their circus sometime
soon.”

“After all, our horses are going to bring our families together,”
Lillya’s father said to the Vronskys as they were leaving. But he didn’t know
how true his words would become.

49

Chapter 9
Road to Kungur, May 1918
Anton gathered a large stick at the beginning of the journey and
marked it each morning to keep track of the days since they left Lillya’s
father’s estate. Without it, they would have lost all track of time. Just one
more long, grueling day, Anton thought as he marked the twig for what he
hoped would be the last time. If I’m right, by day’s end we’ll be able to stop,
and I can finally give that wife of mine a rest. He had become quite
conversant with himself and the horses, too.
After all the traveling, planning, fear and hardships along the way,
Anton said the words she had most wanted to hear for days, “If we hurry, my
dear, I believe we can reach Kungur before sunset.”
Lillya rarely complained. She knew it would do no good. Still, she
had to admit she was looking forward to sleeping in the same place for more
than one night and would be happy to be able to let her guard down a bit
when they settled into wherever they would be staying, however simple or
rustic.
She dedicated one giant yawn and said a quick prayer before getting
down to the business of the day. Soon, she would be able to spend hours
tucked away with her father’s journal, unraveling the secrets she was

50

positive she would find. She felt guilty just thinking about it, remembering
seeing the name Michael, a chill ran up and down her spine. He was taking a
big risk by hiding them. Maybe her father Yuri blackmailed him, or perhaps
Michael was indebted to return a big favor? All in due time, she thought,
smiling at Anton. Enough of their life had been torn apart. She wasn’t so
certain that her father had done her a favor by giving her his journal, but she
couldn’t resist it. Anton recognized that smile but decided for his sake he
was better off not asking her what it meant.
For a while, she had forgotten how tired her feet and legs had become,
not to mention her swollen ankles. She thought about her son Vladimir and
his family. Does he look like his father? Do any of his girls resemble me
perhaps in spirit?
Lillya missed her son horribly and she cursed her country and all of its
stupid political factions for the reasons he lived so far away and for the pain
that she felt from never having held any of her granddaughters, but Anton
had been needed in the early years by his parents and of course Lillya had
her father Yuri. She recited the names of Vladimir’s children. “Let’s see,
Ann Marie Heart, Spade, Diamond Claire, and Lucia Akinsya Club. The last
child was named after herself, as her full name was Lillya Xenia Akinsya
Engelhardt. Akinsya had come from Lillya’s great-grandmother, and she

51

liked thinking there was an old Russian name that she wore, too, floating
around in that young country, the United States.
They had taken a short stop so Lillya could stretch. “If all goes well,
tonight we’ll be sleeping in Kungur,” Anton repeated once more. Then with
hopeful eyes he handed Lillya the reins of Sophie, the sturdy workhorse she
had ridden all of these months. For this trek she needed a calm steady Orlov
Trotter, like Sophie, able to bear a heavy load for days on end, not fazed by
the Russian Arctic wind.
She could see a small supply of hopefulness in Anton’s eyes. Things
were about to change. “If we are lucky, we will arrive around dusk.”
Lillya smiled at Anton. She was thinking of her cousin Michael. She
had a vague recollection of him. She met him once as a child and he had left
quite an impression on her like a map in her memory. She could only have
been four or five because her mother was still alive. They had a simple lunch
together and he did not stay long after the meal. She remembered that day
clearly because her father Yuri had put the guest of honor between Natasha
and Lillya’s mother.
Lillya remembered Michael was very distinguished looking with salt
and pepper hair and he had a mustache that he waxed and wore turned up.
He seemed serious, but then he’d tell a joke, and no one laughed harder than

52

him, and his smile would suddenly grow twice as big. Then he would cough
as if he were choking on his own joke and laugh as if it was too big for even
him. As a young girl she found him very mysterious. She caught her father
sometimes whispering his name. He was her mother’s favorite cousin and
therefore there was an air of myth that surrounded him for no other reason.
“He’s going to be very old,” she said to Anton as he reset the bridle on her
horse. It had somehow gotten twisted.
Then a horrified look covered her own face. “Think of the shock he’ll
have when he sees me!”  Up until that moment she had forgotten about how
much older she had become. But then she thought, all her cousin Michael
would have to do would be to look at her jaw and the small dimple in the
middle of her chin and her painterly nose with a perfect slant. Some things
don’t change; they stay the same. And she wore the family crest just like
every other proud and true Englehardt. Yes, her cousin would believe she
was who she claimed to be. He’d be able to see it in her face. She wore it as
clearly as the statue of David rested his chin on his hand contemplating the
woes of the world and his own.

53

Chapter 10
Yuri’s estate, February 1886.
Yuri could hear giggling coming from Lillya’s room. Lillya had
convinced her father to put another bed in her room for the night so she and
Natasha could live out their dream of being sisters. Lillya’s father had begun
to worry because he knew the truth of their situation, their class difference,
would very soon become a problem. He could shelter them as children but
soon it would not be so easy. Natasha would not be invited to any of the
parties and events that Lillya would attend, and he assumed that after a while
it was going to bother Natasha to dress up her best friend to go to parties
while she had to stay home and clean up the mess they made in the process
of getting dressed. But the one thing Yuri didn’t take into account was just
how left out Lillya felt when all the girls would talk about their mothers.
They would chatter about outings, going for tea or to the seamstress with
their mothers. She really missed Angelika and really wished her special job
had been to just take care of her. Did the angels really need her so badly?
Soon winter would be over, and Lillya’s father had arranged a grand
vacation for the coming summer. He had decided that they would go to
France. Besides the glamor of being in France, Lillya knew that few girls her
age were given this opportunity and that it gave her something they did not

54

have, even if they all had mothers. But sadly, Natasha would not be coming
with them. Her father had explained that she would have a young French girl
helping her with the language, her clothing, the culture, her manners, and by
the end of her time there, he told her she would know the difference between
what was good or bad, for the French were the trendsetters of the world.
What they said set the bar for everyone else.
Quietly, Yuri had thought it a good idea to begin to separate the girls
without them understanding it was planned. He didn’t really like the idea
himself, but culture and class systems were going to dictate every aspect of
their lives and so he thought taking his daughter on an extended vacation
might be a good start. He could think of no better or kinder exciting idea
than this. Yuri went on to bait Lillya, knowing her love of horses, “There’s a
very famous cavalry school in the Loire Valley, in the town in which we will
be staying, Saumur.” Then he winked at her and finished, “If you mind your
manners and are very good, perhaps I will find a way to arrange a tour for
you?” He knew when he said this it would heighten his daughter’s curiosity
and then she would do almost anything he wanted.
“Boys and horses and a famous riding academy,” Lillya silently
thought. “Hmm.” She had to be careful not to let the smile in her eyes take
over her face. “Tell me about this journey you have planned for us,” Lillya

55

smiled mildly. Yuri had rented the east wing of a Chateau in the
northwestern part of France from a man named Sergei who also had a great
interest in horses and cultivated a small grape vineyard from which he made
his own wines.
“The Chateau was built by a famous architect. Sergei will be able to
tell you the story in more detail, but unlike many of the homes in that area,
this one is full of light. Sergei loves to paint when he has the time, and light
is important to him, as is being on the water,” Yuri went on. “There are very
few inclusions one needs to show for one’s house to qualify as being a
Chateau, but there is that one exception.” Lillya was now on the edge of her
seat the way her father drew out his story. Expecting something very large
and dramatic, she was a bit disappointed when her father told her the answer.
“Your home must rest on the Loire River or one of its tributaries,” he stated.
Lillya cried back, “But the Loire River is the longest river in France.
How hard can that be?” Yuri always felt more disappointed in himself when
he disappointed his daughter. “Its beauty has attracted many artists and
many nobles have been drawn to the area like magnets. In the 1400’s, King
Louis XI of France found its beauty so intoxicating, he practically moved the
entire capital of France from Paris to the Loire Valley. Besides, all the

56

nobles were already traveling to the region during the summer and spending
their vacations there. He just made it a little easier for them to do so.”

“I believe Sergei had his house fixed from top to bottom in the late
1860’s, so it is up to date.” Yuri smiled, “You’ll like this; it still has a small
moat and a drawbridge. I’m told it has Belgian and Flemish tapestries
covering many of the walls, and many other beautiful pieces of art, including
some of his paintings.” He sighed for a moment before continuing, “I think it
sounds like a picture from one of your favorite fairy tales. You’ll like it! But
best of all, he has an unusually fine stable of horses. I believe the location
will appeal to your imagination, heart and soul. There are a number of
castles in this region. They were built as fortresses a long time ago, when
they were needed to keep the gentry safe. But now they are used to house
very wealthy families, and their horses are used for breeding, races, and
contests; pleasure, not fighting. You’ll see.”
Then he turned around as if he were planning to change the subject to
something else but couldn’t stop himself from going on. “Some of my
favorite grapes are grown there.” Yuri stopped for a moment, “I wish I could
just count to ten and we’d be there.”

Chapter 11
Road to Kungur, May 1918
Lillya dreamed of spending an afternoon in a comfortable chair next
to a window. Basking in the indulgence of not having to travel every day,
she imagined what it would be like to have her body clean again and not
have to look for a river to jump in. They had all known that they would have
to travel during the summer, for the winter in Kungur would be the coldest
she had ever known.
She laughed when she thought of all the pretty dresses she had left
behind, and wondered about Alexi, her dressmaker, who was now probably
sewing buttons on officers’ uniforms from whichever army had grabbed him
first.
There isn’t much in the way of choices these days, she mused. Life just
happens for all of us now. We wade through muck and sludge that slows us
down or takes us places we never would have chosen to go.
However, for Lillya, Kungur actually sounded exciting, for she was
tired of living in fear and wanted to feel as if she had some control over her
life and its destiny. She wished she could express all her thoughts to Anton,
but he was already frightened for her and if she did, she was afraid they
might scare him more.

58

Being a noble man, Anton set very high expectations for himself, and
he would not budge or lower them to make them easier. Sometimes Lillya
would tease him about his moral code, but deep down inside there was no
one she would trust more with her life if she had to put it in someone else’s
hands. She knew he felt a huge commitment to protect her, even sometimes
from herself. Too often, he would find himself pulling the kite string to bring
her back to safety.
“I understand that there is no time for pleasure today,” Lillya said to
Anton as she bent down to pick a poppy from a field close by. The rain and
unusually warm weather had sent everything to distract her. A golden
summer breeze was working its way in and would push her all the way to
Kungur, she thought. “Let the wind blow me and all our baggage away,” she
said teasingly to Anton. “Blow me into the unknown,” she continued.
She could feel the string in Anton’s hand yanking her back to the
ground. “If only one of my father’s stallions could magically appear, even
for ten minutes, but I can’t afford to think like that, still sometimes I can’t
help myself.” Lillya quieted down. She couldn’t blame Anton for their
predicament, so she continued urging the workhorse forward, kicking the
dirt and muck aside, learning to appreciate the poppies from afar. To pass

59

the time she imagined a little house in Kungur that she would decorate and
call home.
The first thing she saw was a large stone fireplace that rivaled the one
in their townhouse in St. Petersburg, but that was long ago, and she knew her
thought was too big. But most of all, this little house in Kungur would be a
place where she did not have to worry. If times weren’t so bad, we’d still be
at my father’s estate. But for now, I need to reconcile that I can be happy
with a little hint of sunlight caressing my face and not feel the need to run.
When her nose picked up a foul scent, she realized it was herself. She
was certain she was wretched by now and Anton was too kind. Lillya smiled
as thoughts ran through her head, scattering like children on a playground.
Maybe our scents have blended with each other’s and now we don’t know
whose is whose.
“Lillya, where have you been?” Anton asked, knowing quite well the
answer. “We need to stay very alert today. I know it’s very hard, darling, but
today you must listen to my commands. I promised your father I would get
you to Kungur and Michael in safe condition and I’m not about to prove
myself wrong. So, I’ll need your help.”
“Don’t worry, my dear,” Lillya said with a wink. “Don’t you know I
always listen to you?”

60

Anton started to laugh with his deep belly laugh that put a smile on
her face. “Okay, my dear, what direction do we go from here?”
“We want to go northeast. Let me get my compass out.” He reached
into his pocket and took out the trusty compass that had once been his
father’s; the one he had counted on since he was a young boy. Lillya
believed in it, too, for it had gotten them this far.
“Why don’t you tell us, my dear,” Anton said.
Lillya tied her hair back in a bun, pretending it wasn’t even there, and
then said to her husband Anton, “Turn left. I too can smell the leather from
the Kungur factories getting near.”
Lillya and Anton knew so much depended upon what would happen
this day. Would Michael and his friends be there looking for them as her
father had promised, Lillya wondered. Or would he have taken her father’s
money and found he had better things to do than wait for a cousin he hadn’t
seen in forty years who had nothing to offer him but trouble and stories from
the past?
Anton questioned whether Michael’s loyalty was strong enough and
whether he was brave enough to show up at the church every night for
weeks on end, waiting for his cousin and her husband to arrive, when he
hadn’t seen her since she was a child. Anton prayed that he would recognize

61

her. But with the dimple in her chin and her perfect slanted nose Lillya had
no doubt that this Englehardt would recognize another.

62

Chapter 12
Yuri’s estate, March 1886
In late March, before their scheduled trip to France, her father finally
got around to making a date for them to attend a performance of the Vronsky
Family Circus. Lillya was beside herself.
“I can’t believe how excited I am,” Lillya said to Natasha. “I’m finally
going to see that son of theirs that no one has introduced me to. They’re not
going to get away with that tonight, I’m going to insist they introduce us and
if I like him, I’m going to make Papa promise to invite him to see our
stables. I’m told his name is Anton. Can you imagine going out with a boy
that walks a high wire!”
That night Lillya wore her favorite blue lace dress with a blue and
yellow scarf to match. It was the color of the sea at sunset with embroidered
golden threads running through it and burnt orange threads intertwined to
accentuate the gold that looked like the sun setting on the sea. She hoped her
father would like Anton as much as she thought she would. “Maybe he’ll
invite him over to ride next Sunday?” She loudly mumbled to Natasha,
trying to swallow a bite of her dinner at the same time. She could barely
keep her food down. Butterflies were flying so rapidly in her stomach,
fluttering at such a pace, she didn’t know if she could keep her composure. It

63

was if her stomach was their designated migrating ground, only all the action
was not between one tree and then another, but instead inside of her. They
were hitting the wall of her insides so hard and fast she thought one might
escape through her belly button.
When Lillya got nervous Natasha liked to tease her, but this time
Natasha understood the importance of this event for Lillya and decided she
could goad her some other time about something else.
***
Vronsky Family Circus, May 1886
The circus tent was teal blue and burnt orange with a big bright gold
sign that lit up the sky and it read, The Vronsky Family Circus. Located near
the Bolshoi, everyone in St. Petersburg knew where to find it. Dmitri and
Petra Vronsky had arranged a special parking place where Yuri and Lillya
might park their carriage.
Petra and Dmitri seemed to be almost as excited as Lillya and Yuri.
They knew that if Yuri and Lillya spoke highly of the circus, more
aristocrats and members of the upper class would follow their lead. It would
also help to keep them in the good graces of Tsar Alexander III and his wife
Maria. They were escorted to the best seats in the house, front row and

64

center, that had been draped with a beautiful purple fabric that was adorned
with stars and hearts of gold and deep ruby reds.
Lillya noticed all the eyes in the big top tent were staring at her and
she couldn’t help but admit to herself that she liked it and was glad she had
taken the extra time getting dressed for the event. Caught in a web of her
own thoughts when the tigers entered, she smiled at the foolishness of
thinking she could possibly outshine the natural beauty of their coats. They
were wearing the most striking silk she had ever seen and the audience
seemed to agree for their attention quite naturally turned from herself to
them. Her eyes had become fixated on the circus and nothing else, and she
had an instant uncontrollable pining to be a part of it.
“What magnificent creatures!” Lillya said to her father, poking his
elbow until he listened to her. She already had a special affinity for them,
having heard Petra speak of them at dinner. “Their names are Midnight and
Satin,” she said to him as if she had been the only one who had heard the
conversation. And just at that exact moment their trainer brought them
within a breath of their proximity. Midnight opened his mouth as if to show
off his prize-winning sharp teeth. Satin, attached to Midnight, came so close
to them that Lillya felt as if she could almost touch her.

65

And quicker than she could process what had just happened, in
walked the elephants. Lillya had never seen such big creatures. Atop one of
the elephants, dressed in purple satin, was Petra, whose arms, though long,
were impossible to wrap around the big elephant’s neck.
After several tricks and a roar of applause from the audience, Petra
quickly changed clothes and entered the ring playing a flute while standing
upright on her horse’s saddle with a big red feather plume popping out of the
thick satin deeper red headband. Lillya smiled at her father. Petra’s outfit
was a bit risqué, but she was so brilliant in her moves and the way she
commanded her horse that no one could refer to her as cheap or
inappropriate. They could only stare at her in amazement and awe.
Then the moment arrived. Twenty-five feet up in the air was the boy
she had admired from conversation. She had never seen him. A little shorter
and stockier than she had thought for such a position, but seemingly kinder
and cooler than she imagined possible for someone about to embark on such
a treacherous feat. Her heart started to rattle and shake so loud she was
afraid her father might hear it. By the time he started juggling plates and had
walked to the other side, she was already on her feet ready to give a standing
ovation. Realizing how anxious she must look, she sat down.

66

That night when the circus ended, Petra Vronsky arranged a little table
to be put into one of the smaller tents and invited Yuri and Lillya to join
them for some Schnapps, Vodka and pastry. The tent had a nice golden glow
that comforted Lillya. Still, she was a bit nervous, and her father knew it.
“Only a sip,” Yuri reminded Lillya. “Just wet your lips.” Earlier, Yuri had
teased Lillya, saying that he had told Petra they couldn’t come because it
would be too late for his daughter. Lillya turned beet red and just about burst
until she realized her father was joking.
It turned out Lillya was the opposite of shy when it came to Anton
Vronsky. Her tongue wiggled and waggled one sentence, paragraph, page
after another. “He was so easy to talk to,” she told Natasha later that
evening. “I’ve never talked to someone as smart as he that was close to our
age. I think I might be in love.”
Natasha had a pot of chamomile tea waiting for their return, knowing
she would have to calm Lillya down. “Why are we going to stupid France,”
Lillya said later that night to Natasha. She knew she didn’t mean it. Any girl
would give her eyeteeth to have a summer in France, walk the Champs-
Élysées, visit the Cadre Noir in Saumur, and live among the castles most
others would only visit, for the Loire Valley was known to have some of the
largest and most beautiful Chateaux in the world. “The one summer I would

67

want to stay home, father insists we go, and he’s not about to change his
plans!”
Natasha could not feel sorry for Lillya. Oh, how she wished she could
go in her place. But that night when Lillya closed her eyes, the only one she
could see was Anton. Hypnotized by his confidence and talent, he was
throwing one plate and then another higher and higher.

68

Chapter 13

Road to Kungur, June 1918
Drenched in the last of what could be called summer sunlight, they
continued toward Kungur. A sly smile appeared on Lillya’s face. Anton
didn’t want to know the reason why. He could feel his wife’s heart pounding
harder, the closer she thought they were to their destination. Wrapped up in
her own thoughts, she was caught completely off-guard when suddenly, a
boulder came rolling down the hill aimed right where they were walking.
Luckily, Anton had quick reflexes and was accustomed to acting on
instinct just as he had been taught to do since childhood. He urgently
grabbed the horse’s reins, pulled them hard and quickly got them out of the
boulder’s path. Lillya didn’t know what was happening until she felt Anton
give her horse a swift tug, changing her direction and speed and she
suddenly heard the sound of a giant boulder rolling past her.
When it was over, she froze and stood there shaking. It took a minute
or two for her to register just how close she came to dying. Anton had just
saved her life. Anton standing next to Lillya was shaking, too. The boulder
had gotten very close to its target unless it had just been a fluke of nature,
but Anton had to think of himself like a soldier leading the cavalry, and his
job was to deliver precious cargo safely, without a scratch if possible.

69

Anton didn’t really want to know who or what was behind this close
call, their near mishap. He wanted to make light of it and didn’t want Lillya
to become more frightened than she already was. Putting on his best face, he
looked at Lillya with a grave expression and said to her “Man can plan all he
wants, but Nature is a force that has its own mind. It is always going to do
what it pleases and will roar as loud as it wants and cause as much havoc
and hardship as will fill its stomach.”
Lillya replied, “But luckily, my dear, I have you. Nature doesn’t know
the will and the force I have at my side!”
Anton had simply reacted. He hadn’t had time to think. Lillya slowed
her breathing and began to normalize. Silently, her composure returned, her
green eyes began to sparkle, color returned to her cheeks, and one could see
the natural beauty of her youth. She wanted Anton to know she had relaxed.
That they could go forward. Anton, wanting to break the hardened air that
had entered the circle that surrounded them, decided to tell a joke. Lillya
loved that he was trying to make a joke during such a serious time. For only
moments before, getting to Kungur could have been the least of their
worries.

70

Anton knew how to focus more than anything else. Nothing could
break his concentration when he had somewhere to go and something to do,
and in this moment, it was to see a smile on his wife’s face, so he continued.
The Austrian clown Leo told him a funny story. Amused, Anton
smiled to himself when he realized the coat Lillya was wearing had once
been Leo’s wife’s coat. He had talked to Anton about the art of illusion and
how sometimes it could be more powerful than the truth. He spoke about a
clown who had tried to win the one and only position with a circus, but the
circus had advertised that they were looking for a clown who could ride a
unicycle and they were interested in no others.
The clown was so determined that even though he could not ride it, he
bought a unicycle and made it very visible to the owners. And because they
saw the bike, they did not question whether the owner knew how to ride one.
He had only used it as a prop, an illusion, so he would appear more useful so
the circus would hire him. But in reality, his finest skill was sticking a mop
between his legs and running around in circles as if he were a donkey who
had lost his mind and didn’t know which way to go. Mimicking a costumed
mop to look like a donkey got more laughs, anyway. With a unicycle one
needed skill, a mop you just needed imagination, to be able to move your

71

limbs and be funny and give the audience room to laugh. That’s what jokes
are about. Giving the other space and time to find something funny.
Lillya, not wanting to admit that she had been shaken, suggested that
they stop for a short period of time. They could sip some Bergamot citrus tea
just like the Tsar would be doing at this hour had he not been summering on
the other side of the mountain range where they would soon take refuge.
Anton, fearing that the large stone could have come from a misplaced soldier
out for revenge, or simply wanting to steal their horses, urged Lillya on by
talking about the boar they might eat that night, the feast they might have.
A safe place where I can read my father’s journal, without drawing attention
to myself, she thought. In her mind she was going over the directions her
father had given them.
“Enter the back entrance of the church when the parishioners are
leaving after the evening service is complete. In all that commotion it is less
likely anyone will notice you. Still, you must be very careful.”

72

Chapter 14
Yuri’s estate, April 1886
Natasha could hear Lillya tossing and turning. She was excited and
happy for Lillya’s excitement and joy, but she couldn’t help but think about
where all of this might leave her. Was this the beginning of what she knew
one day would come? What she had been so fearful of coming? And Lillya
would turn 16 while in France, without Natasha by her side.
The next morning when Natasha went downstairs to get Lillya’s
breakfast, she noticed that flowers and a note had already been dropped off
for Lillya, she could only guess who they were from. But just then, Yuri
walked into the kitchen. An unusual thing for him to do. He had noticed the
flowers, too, and could only imagine what Natasha was thinking.
“You know these are not from Anton,” Yuri told Natasha. Almost
feeling he was betraying his daughter, he whispered, “These are from Petra.”
This made the two of them even more curious.
Yuri followed Natasha up the steps with Lillya’s breakfast, the
flowers and the note. When they walked into Lillya’s room after first
knocking and Lillya saw the flowers on her tray, before she had a second to
open her mouth, Yuri blurted out, “Isn’t this lovely? You got flowers and a
note from Petra.” You could see the disappointment immediately cross

73

Lillya’s face. However, all three in attendance, including Lillya, knew that if
anything was to go any further it would have to start with the parents, and in
her case it would have to begin with the boy’s mother.
“Why don’t you open the note, my dear,” Yuri said as Natasha handed
her some fresh juice. “Dear Lillya,” it read. “Dmitri and I and Anton were so
pleased to have had your company last evening. We know that when it
comes to animals, you love horses most of all, so I hope the circus did not
bore you.” Lillya interrupted and looked at her father and Natasha and said,
“How could anyone be bored by the circus, it was the most fabulous show I
have ever seen.” Lillya paused for a second and went on, “I could have
given each of them two standing ovations! They were magnificent, weren’t
they Papa?”
Natasha coughed into her hand then picked up the note and said
politely, looking at Lillya and Yuri, “May I continue? There’s more.” Petra
invited Lillya to go riding with her. Lillya could pick out any horse she
wanted from their stable to ride that day. She wanted to know if Lillya could
be available to ride two days from the current day. Lillya’s head was about
to burst once more and before Yuri could express his thoughts, his daughter
penned a short note saying yes, yes, yes!

74

Lillya couldn’t wait for the day to come. She played games with
Natasha and let her win just so she would keep playing and she could keep
herself occupied. She picked flowers and arranged them in beautiful vases,
then brought out her watercolors and painted in a little sunroom off of the
kitchen until the light left the sky and she could barely see. When it got too
chilly, she continued to paint the pictures through the dining room window
close to the large stone fireplace. Mostly, she was certain she would see
Anton again. Each time she thought of him, chills rippled like a cool spring
stream up and down her spine.
Natasha helped Lillya get dressed for Petra. She put on a beautiful
pale-yellow dress that had a scarf that went with it that was stamped with
purple orchids. Lillya loved orchids. For Anton, she would have Natasha
gather flowers from the gardener in the greenhouse and put the flowers in
her hair. About to walk out the door to grab some air so she would look fresh
when Petra’s carriage arrived to take her to their stable, a rider unexpectedly
approached the house asking for Lillya. He was carrying a note. It was from
Anton, Dear Lillya, it said I am sorry, but I have been called away to
answer business directed at my father. I’m sorry we will not have a chance
to formally get together before I leave. Today is the day I have to go. I’m
afraid it may be some time before we have another opportunity to exchange

75

thoughts and ideas. My mother has explained to me that you will be leaving
for France before my return. I find it sad that timing could get so in the way
of discovering who you really are. This may be quite forward of me, but I’m
wondering if you would meet for a few minutes right now. I know it won’t be
for very long.
The expression on Lillya’s face completely changed and she began to
read silently, keeping the words from Anton between only the two of them.
Could you meet me in five or ten minutes behind your father’s barn? I can’t
bear the thought of not speaking to you without getting one word in right
before I lose you to the horses and boys of France.
Lillya looked at Natasha with pleading eyes, then showed her the
note. “Will you help, Natasha?” Lillya asked. Natasha, knowing Lillya’s
stubborn streak, and that Lillya would go with or without her, nodded her
head, yes.
Lillya’s father was back in his library working away, so Lillya had a
short window of time to do as she pleased, but she knew she’d better move
fast. Natasha ran to grab Lillya’s hand and together they quickly ran behind
the barn paying no attention to the stable boys.
Several minutes later, Lillya could hear footsteps coming up from
behind. Trying to remain calm, she took a breath and then three others.

76

Natasha took both Lillya’s hands into her own and just that action
alone helped her heart retain its normal beat. Not knowing what to say when
Anton arrived, she simply remained silent. Lillya and Anton shyly
embraced. Lillya knew his thoughts. She knew he would wait for her while
she was in France. Quickly, he kissed her on the cheek, a typical French
greeting, but his lack of words told her everything. Then he turned towards
her with a big smile on his face, jumped on his horse and left.
Lillya tried to take a step forward but almost fell back. Then she
looked at Natasha and said, “It’s a good thing I don’t walk the rope.”
Natasha started laughing and gathered Lillya’s things and together they
headed back toward the house.
Lillya’s head was spinning. “He kissed me,” she whispered. “He
kissed me!”
When Petra’s carriage arrived, she was much more silent than she
would have normally been. Her head was somewhere else as she played that
last scene with Anton over and over as if they were rehearsing the final
scene of a play in a theater. Petra, a smart female, sensed the feelings behind
Lillya’s demeanor and said to herself, “I have no doubt my son had
something to do with this.”

77

Chapter 15
Road to Kungur, June 1918 – Same day as Chapter 13
They had fared fairly well. Their supplies had lasted and soon they
would be among friendly company, have the underground support of a
nearby church and a few of its most trusted members would help them to
hide. Just thinking of it, Lillya started to feel the butterflies in her belly. She
could barely wait to be around trusted company and sit at a proper table,
drink wine and converse. Simply allowing these thoughts brought back
memories of her father, and she wondered if he was still alive. Her father,
she suspected, would be in his study waiting for the soldiers’ arrival, and
whether they be Red or White he would let them know, it was his patriotic
duty to give up his estate to and for the people. Then if they were Reds he
planned on shouting “Comrade,” and if they were Whites, he would offer up
his very best wine.
Her father and grandfather knew nobles that had kept 300,000 serfs.
“What family needed such excess?” Behind closed doors Lillya recalled a
conversation with her father earlier that year. “They got too greedy,” he
continued. “And now if they leave, they most likely leave with nothing. If
they were lucky and smart they hid some of their family jewels. One
necklace could buy them passage to America and keep them alive. I hope

78

you didn’t send every last emerald and ruby to the States and remembered to
keep a few for yourself and Anton.” She listened attentively but said not a
word.
Lillya found solace in knowing their affairs with the circus and their
home had been settled before their world turned completely upside down.
Thank goodness Anton and her father were forward-thinking men. Together
they had made arrangements for her son Vladimir in the United States and
provided him with more than enough to assure the legacy of his family and
the circus.
Anton came from a long line of circus people, and he had inherited his
family’s circus, but that was many years ago. He had since given the circus
to his son, who took it from Russia to Europe, then made a home in the
southern United States traveling from one town to the next. But it was
Lillya, it was her pedigree the armies would be most interested in. She was
the reason they were running.
Anton and Lillya tried not to think about what had just happened. The
boulder that fell had scared her, but Anton was sure-footed. Even so, he
wondered, was it a random act of violence, was it some bored kid playing
some sort of game or was it a displaced soldier from the Red or White army

79

hoping that if he brought back several horses and two prisoners that he might
once again return to their good graces?
Lillya could see the thoughts jumping around in Anton’s head, but she
knew better than to ask him, for it would only stir things up and make them
feel worse. They should just be grateful that nothing happened to them or
their horses or even the displaced boy; after all she had a son and would
hope that any mother would look at these almost children and think of their
own progeny as well when making decisions.
So, she quickly changed the subject and surprisingly found herself
speaking of Donatalia, the daughter of her old friend Katya from whom she
had learned this tea recipe. Katya was the first person who had ever made it
for her, oh so many years ago. For just a few seconds she could see this
young girl dressed in her New Year’s best, trying not to have the son of their
hostess notice she was counting her forks and spoons. Trying very hard to
act grown up. She could see Donatalia unable to contain her excitement as
Anton told one story after another. Anton was in rare form that night, Lillya
remembered.
Standing in the open so close to where the boulder could have so
easily taken her life. Anton didn’t know if his joke of the clown had worked,
but something he had done or said he was certain had triggered the smile

80

that now appeared on her face. Lillya brought herself back to where they
were standing and to that exact moment in time. Visions of ice castles and
princesses and elephants carrying a cage disappeared when she heard her
husband’s voice break through the chatter that was going on in her head.
“I think it’s time we get back on the horses,” Anton said. “We’ve
indulged in too much time already.”
“You won’t find any disagreement here,” Lillya answered back. “I’m
more than ready and my feet are, too.”
The scare with the boulder left both Lillya and Anton tense. They
didn’t have much farther to go, but anything could happen. Anton tried to
remind himself of this each step that they took and tried to remind Lillya too,
without being too pesky. He told her, “Probably only four or five hours more
to go before we arrive at Kungur.”
Kungur was their final destination, for now at least. Still, he didn’t
want to get Lillya’s hopes too high. The closer they got, the harder their
journey seemed to become. It felt almost impossible. Lillya didn’t know
time could move so slowly. But looking at the sun and the way it was
positioned in the sky and the speed at which they were traveling, Anton felt
fairly certain they would make it. Besides, he couldn’t bear the thought of
his wife sleeping outdoors for one more night.

81

Lillya had put on a good face. She didn’t want to show Anton how
frightened she had been by many of the obstacles they encountered along the
way, especially the boulder. Yet she couldn’t stop her mind from thinking
what could happen if they were found out.  She felt guilty for having gotten
Anton into this upper-class cauldron of trouble. She thanked God for having
made her a woman, for the worst that would happen to her would be prison,
but a man would most likely be sent to the front lines and certain death.
Besides, what would they want with me? Lillya had created numerous
internal conversations with many imaginary people since they left. It made
sense since there was nothing to do but to walk and talk. Each step they took
was bringing them closer to a new life, like it or not. However, Lillya had
made up her mind to make the best of it. What else can I do? she thought.

82

Chapter 16
The Vronsky Family Circus Stable, St. Petersburg, April 1886
“My dear, you’re quite a rider. I knew you were talented, but I didn’t
realize you were better than I am,” laughed Petra. Lillya and Petra were
returning the horses to Petra’s groom.
The groom spoke out, “You rode ‘em hard, Miss Petra. He’s going to
need a good brushing today.” He winked at Lillya, “You didn’t have
anything to do with this, did you?”
“No, I would never ride a horse so hard.”
“Oh no, not you,” the groom said with a smile.
Petra looked at Lillya and the groom and started to laugh. “I think,
Ivan, there might be a new member to the circus one day soon.”
Ivan, besides being a groom by day and overseeing the stables, got to
perform at night swallowing fire. Yes, he was the fire eater and loved
learning new tricks, but he practiced those far away from the stables and
simply talked to the horses about his accomplishments but never showed
them what he could do.
***
Yuri’s Estate, April 1886

83

Lillya was flying as high as a kite when she got back home. She
barely said hello to her father when she ran up the stairs about to burst,
yelling for Natasha. “His mother’s amazing!”
“Calm down, Lillya, calm down. I’m certain she’s wonderful, but we
have all night to discuss her.”
Lillya, with a sullen face, walked out terribly disappointed. Natasha
didn’t seem to take her crush on Anton as seriously as she did.
Natasha was playing with the nightclothes in Lillya’s closet and was
deliberately making a lot of noise to cover up the sound of Lillya’s happy
voice. Lillya had been gone all day enjoying something while she had stayed
home cleaning out the bathtub. She knew it was her duty, but when would
that change?
In truth, Natasha had actually had quite a bit of fun while Lillya was
out, but she didn’t want Lillya to know it. For a few moments it was better,
Natasha thought, for Lillya to think that she had stayed home lonesome and
bored, but it was far from the truth. Yuri wanted to surprise his daughter and
had hired one of the best French seamstresses in all of St. Petersburg to
make some new dresses for Lillya to take to France, and the seamstress had
asked for one more fitting. Instead of bringing Lillya, her father brought
Natasha.

84

The dressmaker, like anyone dealing with the upper crust of Russian
society, spoke only in French to Yuri, assuming Natasha, a maid, would not
know a word of the aristocratic language spoken amongst themselves, meant
to help separate the working classes from the elite. Natasha smiled when
Yuri winked at her, for with her photographic memory she had memorized
all of Lillya’s studies throughout the years, including her near perfect
French.
For several hours Natasha could almost believe this was her life, that
of a mistress and heiress instead of a handmaid. The dressmaker and Yuri
left the room to discuss fabric and prices. Natasha caught a glimpse of
herself in a large silver plate and gave her reflection a big smile of approval.
Yuri returned with the fabric in his right hand but in his left hand he now
carried a box filled with jewels.
You can pick one for yourself he told Natasha and one for Lillya.
Out of loyalty and love, Yuri noticed she picked the nicest piece for his
daughter
By the time dinner was through, both Lillya and Natasha had let go of
their artificial disappointments in the other. Besides, Lillya would be leaving
for France in one week’s time. Natasha knew that she would be missing her
best friend, and Lillya felt the same way, too.

85

Natasha was like her sister, and she couldn’t imagine being without
her for any length of time, but she couldn’t get Anton off her mind. He was
so bold, she thought. He came to my father’s home, asked me to meet him
secretly and gave me a kiss.
Without a mother to help raise his daughter, Lillya understood that her
father had become more open-minded than many fathers. He wasn’t trying
to hold himself up as the finest example of Russian society. After all the
sadness he had seen his wife endure, he wanted nothing more than happiness
for his daughter. Educated by some of the best French teachers in all of St.
Petersburg, she had been tutored and raised to fit into society, and therefore
Natasha secretly believed, so had she.
He branded me with his lips, Lillya reflected on Anton. She couldn’t
get the feelings and what they meant off her mind nor wash them away. She
wanted some distraction; she wanted some laughter and fun.
Natasha worried for Lillya because she could read the fearlessness and
audacity in Lillya’s sparkling green eyes, and they foreshadowed trouble.
Lillya had no inkling of the dangers Natasha saw because she was of an age
when nothing was taken too seriously, and life was little more than a game
until it wasn’t.

Yuri’s estate, May 1886
The French had infiltrated Russia with their art, their dance, their
drama and their food by now. Although the Russian’s were getting stronger
in their dance it was hard for anyone to beat out the French, but everyone
tried.
Her father set up reservations on an ocean liner. Yuri’s planned trip
was suddenly in competition with young love, and he found himself
describing the beauty of where they would be traveling as if he were a
famous French painter wanting to entice a museum or a buyer. “One of the
most famous chateaux in the valley is Chateau de la Chance.  It sits on the
bank of the Layon River and was built in the 11th century. Flowers and
artichokes line the river, as do beautiful grape vines that are later pressed
into some of my favorite wines.”
“Mmmm,” Lillya said with a big approving smile on her face. Yuri
knew he would not have to work very hard for his daughter's approval on
where they would be going and with whom they would be staying,

The difficulty would be in separating his daughter from Natasha and
this new blood and excitement she found jiggling inside her bones. She
could see that her father was even more excited than she to be taking this
trip. It was the place he felt he belonged more than anyplace other than his

87

own home. He saw the land, its rich beauty and perfect soil, as a part of him.
A part of his deepest self. It was in his blood, the marrow of his bones, and
this connection acted like a carrier pigeon, programmed to always bring him
home, and while Lillya’s mother was still alive, she made him promise that
he would never abandon their Russia and he would always do whatever was
necessary to keep Lillya in Russia, steeped in Russian culture and heritage.
Lillya was overwhelmed by the stories of the beauty and largeness of
these French castles her father described and the many others that had been
built in this region. She had seen wealth before, but by the way her father
described the natural passion and joy these people seemed to possess, they
sounded magical.
The French had influence in Russia from art to architecture and
became the standard bearers on what was considered good. So, any young
Russian girl would be more than thrilled to experience the French culture
and be able to say that she had walked the Champs-Élysées in Paris, and it
was more beautiful than she could have imagined. Even though their
destination would be Saumur, Yuri knew that he had to plan their
transportation to include a short stay in Paris, too.
There were two ways of luxury travel between St. Petersburg and the
Loire Valley, and Yuri decided he would indulge his daughter in both. They

88

would take a luxury suite in a steamship passing through the Baltic Sea,
going around Denmark and eventually landing in the French Port of
Bordeaux. There he would have a caravan of stagecoaches waiting to take
them to their final destination of Saumur, home of the famed equestrian
academy, the Cadre Noir. The return trip would be by first-class train coach
with stops in Paris, Brussels and Berlin.

Chapter 17
Road to Kungur, June 1918 – Same day as Chapter 15
Out of nowhere, a bolt of lightning lit the sky and thunder shook the
earth. She tried to think of what horrible deed had been done to make God so
angry. She was certain it was a man’s doing.
“We don’t need this,” Anton said out loud, seeming to try to make up
for the mishaps of his gender as the rain fell like pennies from the sky in big
circular drops that could have passed for cherries.
Lillya was upset because the rain was ruining the game that she had
made up to keep her mind occupied. She liked to guess how many steps they
had taken, since the last time she added them up, but for now the rain was
rinsing them away. The footsteps had been witness to their journey and the
rain was erasing the evidence of all her hard work. So instead, she found
herself becoming transfixed by the sounds of the little bubbles that were
popping underneath her feet as the rain made its way into the earth.
It felt childlike making up games like this, but she had to find a
different way of dealing with time and learning patience along the way. Now
the stakes were too high to be playing make-believe. The game board her
father and the men of his generation had set up for them left no time for
frivolity, this was life and death!

90

Anton knew he had no choice but to trust the plan that Lillya’s father
had set up for them with his cousin, Michael. By now they were in too deep
and no one else, friends or relatives, seemed to owe her father a bigger favor,
a favor of the magnitude they were asking. Walking in the rain, the sound of
the little bubbles continued popping under her feet.
When Anton had estimated they were about an hour from Kungur and
the church, Lillya reached into her bag and pulled out an old scarf to tie
around her head. She’d be able to tuck her hair inside of it, covering up most
of her gray and helping her to disguise her true identity. They started to see
other travelers on the path going in the opposite direction. Lillya wondered
why they were leaving but didn’t dare try to venture into any sort of
conversation or recognition more than a nod.
Testing his memory, Anton began to recite Yuri’s instructions to the
church. “You will go to the lower part of the town,” her father continued.
“On Kittarskaya Street is the Uspenskaya Church. My cousin Michael is
friends with the parish priest.” He repeated them over and over until finally
the church came into view. Both became more cautious as they inched in
closer to their final destination. Lillya grabbed her husband’s hand, unable to
anticipate what could happen next.

91

The congregation was chanting the Dismissal Hymn, a familiar song
from Lillya’s childhood. Lillya was about to whisper something to Anton
when he put his finger to her mouth, signaling her to be quiet.
“Shhhh” he said to his wife. “We must stay very quiet, my love.
Michael will find us.”
Lillya bit her tongue. Anton motioned for her to stay put. He wanted
to check out their surroundings. Lillya wasn’t too pleased. Happily, Anton
returned a few minutes later with news.
“There’s a big bramble of blackberry bushes close by.” He pointed to
an old gardening shed. “I think that will provide some cover this time of
day,” he said after seeing a questioning look in Lillya’s eyes.
“The hymn, the one they’re singing, I sang it as a girl.” She smiled,
hoping to lighten the mood. “It was our closing hymn. No time to deliberate.
I think we’d better get ready; the congregation will charge through that front
door very soon.”
Anton and Lillya found their way to the blackberry bramble by the
shed.
“Do you think Michael will be here tonight?” Lillya asked.

92

“I don’t know, my love, but if not, he will have sent someone in his
place. Don’t worry. He’s going to take very good care of you. Of that, I am
sure!”

Anton had tried to keep his own questioning to himself, afraid that the
power of doubt would prove him right.
“Anyway, there is no turning back.” Anton said softly. He noticed an
old beggar out of the corner of his eye. The beggar nodded in recognition.
Anton just ignored him.
Anton gave Lillya a peck on her cheek to assure her. “Everything’s
going to be fine,” he whispered and squeezed her hand. Wanting in some
way to acknowledge how far they had come, Lillya lightly kissed him on the
lips.
Lillya’s and Anton’s intimacy did not stop the beggar from coming
closer. The old man motioned to Anton, wanting them to move closer to
him. But Anton and Lillya stayed put. For a second, Lillya drifted to
thoughts of her son Vladimir. She wondered how many obstacles he had had
to cross to make his new home. And for a second; for a minute would be too
painful, she imagined her granddaughters, whom she had never had a chance
to meet.

93

“How horrible,” Lillya thought, “that men and politics break up so
many families by starting wars.” But when thinking of Vladimir, she felt a
sense of satisfaction, for she believed they had done what was necessary to
secure that he and his family were safe.
The people from the church scattered. A few went behind the church
where Lillya and Anton were. Lillya heard some coughing from behind. She
jumped and made a small jerky motion. Hoping no one noticed her, she
turned only to see the beggar. Lillya decided to pay him no attention. Her
sights were on someone else.
The parishioners out front of the church were seemingly starting to
finish saying their goodbyes and a pain of fright mixed with abandonment
kicked her in the belly. The beggar, the only one vying for their attention,
became annoying.

Anton whispered into Lillya’s ear, “He might have had other things to
do tonight. It’s not as if he was given a specific date of our arrival. He’s
probably been outside this church the last three nights and decided to take a
break and didn’t want to appear more religious than he is. Anton tried to
reassure his wife. “We’ll wait a little longer, but if he doesn’t show up
tonight, don’t lose faith, my dear. Your father would never put a plan in
motion that involved your life without almost 100 percent certainty that it

94

would work out. If necessary, we will have to go back into the forest for one
more night.”
Anton could see the sadness on her face; the disappointment of no
reward, when suddenly the parish priest approached them with the beggar at
his side. Without wasting a breath, he introduced himself, then instructed the
beggar to take over the reins of Anton and Lillya’s horses and to follow him.
All Lillya and Anton knew was that they needed to listen. The parish priest
was the key to their future.
They walked down a dark and narrow dirt lane and eventually stopped
in the back of a carriage house that looked like all the others they had
passed, only this one had a small cross embedded in the wooden door. The
priest directed them to enter the premises.
Lillya noticed a small lantern lit in the window and a strong green
vine that was growing up the sides of the structure as if to frame the building
like a painting. Lillya took a step back to take in the broader view. Upstairs
looked to be a place where people could sleep and live and downstairs was
clearly a place to rest their horses and belongings.
“We can talk inside,” the priest said softly. “Pardon me, by the way,
my name is Nikolai.” Finally, Anton and Lillya knew the name of the parish
priest.

95

“You will be quite comfortable here and out of the way,” the priest
continued. “Still, always take the back road when you are coming and going.
Your cousin Michael will come here in the morning with his wife Gretta and
my wife Helena. His house is down the street, but you will be safer here,
staying with me in our home,” he said directly to Anton. “No one would
dare question or disturb the parish priest. Your husband will be known as my
uncle,” he explained.
Lillya had not realized before now, seeing the priest in the soft lantern
light, how young he was. “How brave is he,” she thought, “for helping his
friend Michael’s family.”
“There are some clean blankets on the bed,” he said when they had
climbed the steps and entered the door to what would be Anton and Lillya’s
new home. It was small and simple, but clean and cozy, and it had one small
window with a table and chair in front of it that would gather the southern
light. Lillya smiled when she saw it. Anton, seeing Lillya happy, smiled too.
“There is fruit and bread and a hard piece of meat that you can cut.
We weren’t quite certain when you’d arrive. Michael will be happy to
receive this news. I will see you in the morning.” Anton thanked the priest,
gave the beggar some change and went back upstairs to help his wife settle
in.

96

Chapter 18
Yuri’s Private Office, May 1886
“I’d like you to move and take Natasha with you.” Yuri said to Sonya
in confidence. “Lillya will be introduced to society when we return from
France and Natasha is going to be, how can I say it, left behind. It will be
difficult for both of them. I will arrange a job and a new home for you. I
have a contact in Odessa, you’ll like it there. Natasha has always loved the
water.”
“It’s not going to be easy separating these two,” said Natasha’s
mother. “Your daughter has been the best part of Natasha’s life, but I’ll do
what you think is best because up to now you’ve been right all along. I thank
you for your years of kindness and generosity.
***
The Estate of Sonya’s employer, May 1886 – A few days later
Natasha threw a fit when she found out what was going to be
happening; that she was going to be leaving the only home that she had ever
known. She had just finished helping Lillya pack for her trip to France and
said her goodbyes, and now this may have been their actual goodbye
forever.

97

That morning, when she arrived at the house where her mother
worked, she went along to the back door as she was always told she had to,
and when they opened, she saw three suitcases. It was very confusing to
Natasha. Who would leave three suitcases at the door, and where would they
be going? She wondered to herself, imagining what it would be like to take a
real trip. When her mother got to the door, she was dressed in a nice long
dress that was olive green and double-breasted at the top with big, beautiful
gold buttons. She gave her daughter a kiss, and instead of inviting her in, she
told her to take one of the suitcases, that she was going to need help. This
made no sense to Natasha, but she did it anyway.
Soon a carriage came up the long driveway to the main house where
her mother had a room, and her mother looked at Natasha and told her to get
into the carriage. “Where are we going and what do you have in mind?”
Natasha started to feel a little frantic and disoriented, for nothing her mother
was doing made sense. But her mother got a certain look on her face and
Natasha could tell that she meant what she was about to say. “I’m leaving,”
her mother said, “and you’re coming with me.” Natasha looked at her
mother as if she were nuts. What did she mean by this? Her mother said,
“It’s time for you and Lillya to be separated. It’s time for you to build your
own life, and today’s the day we’re doing it.” Natasha had nothing of hers

98

packed and more than anything, emotionally, she couldn’t imagine a life
without Lillya in it day-to-day. They had been together since they were
children. How could her mother yank her out like this?
The carriage moved quickly down the long gravel lane and at the end
of the driveway was Yuri. He had packed up Natasha’s other things and had
them ready for Natasha’s mother to pick up. He gave Natasha a kiss on both
cheeks and told her she would always be looked after and she shouldn’t
worry, but today was the day that both she and Lillya had to grow up and
accept each of their own stations in life and appreciate that they could no
longer be associated in the way they had been.
“I know this is going to be difficult,” Yuri said, “Lillya, I’m sure, is
going to throw a fit when she comes home and finds you not there, but it
needs to be done. I’ve got positions for both you and your mother in Odessa.
You will be near the sea and well taken care of. Now, I don’t want to
prolong this because it will be painful for each of us. I appreciate what you
have done for my daughter, but she needs to take up her new position in life
and it’s time for you to make progress in yours.”
A baffled Natasha got back in the carriage and rode off. She couldn’t
hold back the tears that were streaming down her face. She couldn’t have
been more shocked. It was as if someone had blown her out of a cannon,

99

expecting her to find justice and a reason for their actions, and that they were
expected to be okay by her and clearly, they were not. She started yelling at
her mother, “How could you let this happen? How could you let him do this
to us? Lillya’s really going to be angry - he’s going to be sorry. I thought he
was my friend.”
Her mother took her hand and slowly patted her head of hair, trying to
calm her daughter down. She didn’t like the situation any better than
Natasha did, but she knew they were lucky to have a patron such as Yuri
looking after them, and they had been given a position and enough money
that they would survive. If they needed more, Natasha’s mother was certain
that Yuri would send it. So, Natasha went on to Odessa, heartbroken and
sad, feeling betrayed by the one person she had most trusted in life. She had
never thought about herself leaving; she assumed that she and Lillya would
be bound together for life, but she understood now that Yuri had never
meant it to be, that he had some idea about Natasha as a disposable
employee that he was giving a generous pension to, an animal he was
putting out to pasture or selling to another owner, not a daughter or sister to
his daughter. He had a plan, but he hadn’t thought through it quite
completely, he hadn’t taken hearts into account, and now the day had come
for the life she had known to end and it would be time for her to plant new

100

seeds and discover who she was as an individual and what she was meant to
do and see.
***
Odessa, May 1886
They got to the house that Yuri had bought for them. It was a simple
but charming cottage near the Primorsky Stairs where just she and her
mother could live. She had never done that before, her entire life she
couldn’t remember when she and her mother had actually been together for
more than two or three days, but they were set up to take care of some
children at a nearby house and at night they would come back to their own.
Natasha cursed when she wasn’t in the presence of her new masters. She
made life as difficult as she could for her mother, hoping that she would
change her mind and send Natasha back to the place where she was happy,
but a week had passed and there was still no sign of her mother changing
anything about their new situation and then two months, six months and a
year, Natasha was still ranting and raving.
Lillya threw a fit as well, but it didn’t last as long, for she had the
distraction of the man she loved, Anton and her once in a lifetime trip to
France. Her father told her that Natasha’s mother had gotten a job in Odessa
and was going to be leaving, and it was only right that her daughter was able

101

to come with her. He let Lillya know that he had checked out the situation to
make certain it was safe and was one where both Natasha and her mother
would thrive, because Lillya needed to have certainty that they would be
alright.
Yuri wanted to believe that the decision he had made was one that
would be best for both Lillya and Natasha and by convincing himself of this,
he actually felt a little puffed-up, thinking he was quite smart and that he had
done a good thing. He had taken care of Natasha most of her life and made
certain that for a person of her station she had been given a bit of education
and that she would have the tools to be worthy of good positions as an adult
and in time would feel differently, but Natasha did not see it that way. She
felt betrayed and she swore she would not get close to anyone else ever
again because she never wanted to feel this kind of hurt again.

102

Chapter 19
Church Carriage House in Kungur, June 1918
Anton was already out taking care of the horses when two women
approached the carriage house gently knocking on the door. “My name is
Helena,” one said. “Nikolai is my husband, and I’ve brought you a few
things for the house. With me is Gretta, your cousin Michael’s wife,” and
with that Lillya smiled and opened the door. The women kissed Lillya on
both cheeks as was the custom, and Lillya responded by introducing herself.
“Why, I would have recognized you anywhere,” Gretta smiled.
Michael is right, an Englehardt wears their family crest on their face,” and
the three women laughed. “We came to help you get settled in. I know it is
not what you are used to, and last night had to be difficult and somewhat
confusing, but we have all had to adjust to the times,” Gretta sighed.
“I also brought you some bergamot tea,” Helena smiled. “It’s our way
of saying prayers for our country and the Tsar and his family and it reminds
us of better days. And it’s our way of welcoming you.”
Gretta was tall and very striking-looking with thin lips and a long dark
brown mane of wavy hair. Lillya was surprised how little gray she had for a
woman of her age. Helena was much plainer, but pretty in her own way.
Lillya’s eyes lit up the morning sky, which was beginning to change its

103

mood from blue gray to a crisp golden orange. Gretta pulled out some
delicious-looking morning biscuits. Lillya caught the scent of fresh baked
grains and the smell of cinnamon.
“You know, I met you as a child. I was younger than you are now.
Michael, my Michael, had quite a crush on your mother. He thought the
world of her. Yuri, your father, took it in stride. I think he was used to it. Oh,
I’m sorry. I’m speaking to you as an adult woman forgetting that the mother
is always the mother. Your mother was quite confusing. No one felt they
could compete with her in any way. My husband made a fool of himself
sometimes.”
“This is going to be a happy reunion,” Helena jumped in.
Lillya smiled, wondering, though, how Michael’s wife really felt
about taking such risks with their lives and then she began to think about all
the secrets her father had obviously kept. What secrets would his journal
reveal about them all? This woman, Michael’s wife, was her cousin by
marriage. Her proper name was Margaretta Villanova until she became an
Englehardt. Could she be the key? What did she know?
Lillya brightened, “I will boil some water for us. This wonderful black
tea is a special treat.” Gretta chimed in, “Michael should be here soon I
know Anton was anxious to meet us both.”

104

Older than Lillya, Gretta still maintained a good sense of humor and
zest for life and love even though she, like Lillya, had lost much of what
she’d thought would be hers. Lillya could see that these women might
become new friends. Oh, how happy Lillya was to hear voices other than her
own and Anton’s. She loved her husband dearly, but she was in need of
other companions and the sound of stories and laughter that only other
people could bring with them. In return they could retell interesting stories
and events their circus employees and entertainers had shared with them.
Surely, they had enough interesting stories from the circus to last most
people two lifetimes. Unfortunately, with strangers, that’s what they would
have to share, but who knew what the future would bring?
Both she and Anton needed to hear the sound of opinions even if it
only gave them a source of conversation and debate for later, when they
would find themselves alone at night. Tonight, they would gather in
conversation. Perhaps one day soon they would even help her in their search
for Natasha.
By the time Anton returned to the house, the women were chattering
away. Anton, so happy that his wife was engaging animatedly in
conversation, handed her a small bouquet of wildflowers that he had picked
along the way back. The women were talking about a celebration they

105

wanted to have that evening. “I thought you might like these, my dear,” he
said as he handed them to Lillya.
Anton and Nikolai began to store the goods they had collected, and
the women slowly began turning the carriage house into a home.
Finally, Michael walked through the door, the main attraction as far as
Lillya was concerned. Lillya found him to be surprisingly jubilant
considering their situation. Not an ounce of fear on his face and no clue that
he could be involved in a scheme of hiding dangerous aristocrats.
“Lillya,” he smiled, “it’s been too long and how is that father of
yours? He was always my favorite relative. But then again, he was the one
who won the heart of Angelika. Quite a feat. She truly was an angel on
earth! Born to do things we couldn’t even understand.” Lillya tried to take it
all in without showing her feelings. She gave him a brief, sad, recent history
of her father and tried not to tear up too much.
“I like to think that he’s still at home, walking his horse, carrying a
bottle of his favorite wine at his side, there with Stephano his houseman at
hand to keep him company and to listen to his stories. But truthfully, I don’t
know if he is alive or dead. Lillya welled up as if she were a ten-year-old girl
and it greatly embarrassed her. “I believe the creaky sound of the old

106

wooden floor is helping to keep him company. And he’s very good at having
conversations with himself.”
“But today is a joyous occasion and we must be grateful for these
moments we have together,” Michael said in deep reflection. “No one knows
how many more we will have or what tomorrow will bring,” he said while
thinking of all of the friends he had lost but remembering why he had to
remain in a grateful frame of mind.
“You are right, cousin. I promise not to be so solemn at dinner
tonight,” and with that Lillya gave him her best Englehardt smile.
Michael took her aside and spoke to her confidentially, “The parish
priest, Nikolai, is a generous soul, but he has also been paid well for the task
at hand. No one is truly safe these days, but I think you should be as
comfortable here as anywhere else. Certainly, much safer than if you had
stayed with your father. I hope you’ll send my regards to him when the
opportunity allows. He is a good man who has had to rise above much
sadness, the illness of your mother, but you and I will talk about that another
time. It upsets Gretta and right now you want her on your side.”
Lillya didn’t quite understand what her cousin meant. She took a deep
breath. Although she had been waiting for this moment, she began to feel
uncomfortable in her own skin.

107

Helena spoke up cheerily to the assembled group, “Nikolai and I have
established a very loyal congregation, and he has told them that his uncle
was coming to stay for a while, so people will welcome you with open arms
and not apprehension, gossip or mystery.”
Lillya opened the windows to get some air inside the house and to
blow away some of the intrigue and mystery. A nice swift breeze came
through and sprinkled the scent of Kungur leather, leaving a reminder of
where she was, on the tip of her nose.
“It’s been a long hard journey” Lillya finally said, “but I look forward
to hearing stories about my mother. I was very young when she passed
away. For now, though, I believe I need a nap.”
“I think we are going to have plenty of time to get to know one
another.” Michael kissed her on both cheeks as did the priest’s wife and
Gretta. He and Anton hugged a deeper hug than normal for they knew within
this gesture they had made a promise to take care of one another’s family. A
gesture from where there was no turning back. If one got caught aiding and
abetting, the other one did, too.
Lillya wanted to feel worthy of the favor her father had asked. She felt
quite sure that her father had already fulfilled his end of the request many

108

years prior, for he was not one to ask others for help. Except his houseman
Stephano to whom he had been paying a lofty monthly sum and more.
What is the secret they are both keeping, Lillya wondered about her
father and Michael. He must have something on her cousin equal in value.
But what, she asked herself as she tossed and turned her way to sleep.

109

Chapter 20
Loire Valley, France, May 1886
The steamship was quite entertaining, but Lillya preferred land over
sea. Her stomach gurgled constantly, and her father carried a bucket and
walked beside her, but she enjoyed herself nonetheless and enjoyed
daydreaming in her suite.
With each breath Lillya took, St. Petersburg seemed to be farther
away and their house there, which had always been considered large, would
soon feel small.
Lillya and her father arrived at the Chateau St. Jacque just as the
women were finishing airing out the rooms one after another each more
beautiful than the last. Exotic lanterns illuminated a tulip fresco of engraved
flowers colored with a deep dripped oil of golden yellow that in its center
almost looked orange. Tulips seemed to be in every room and everywhere on
the grounds they were going to inhabit.
There was laughter echoing from the dining room when Lillya and her
father arrived. Then two little boys who were playing tag and hide-and-seek
using large marble statues and a giant marble vase to shield themselves came
tromping in. They had no idea that their playground was at all unusual until

110

their father walked in and reminded them to mind their manners. “Silence!”
he barked. “I promised your mother I’d teach you to behave.”
Yuri and Lillya found the situation funny. Sergei, the children’s
father, had wanted to make a nice impression on the father and daughter who
had come such a distance to rent the east wing of his chateau for the
following few months. Still, he knew his boys had charm enough to win over
any crowd, let alone that of a tired teenaged girl who had been cooped up on
a ship for days, no matter how luxurious her suite was.
“What’s that dirt you have on the bottom of your pants and on your
shirt?” their father asked. “I’m certain Sofiya will be quite disappointed –
she put a lot of care into dressing you this morning.” But clearly the little
boys carried no guilt or fear. Sergei winked at Sofiya as she entered the
room.
Having heard Sergei, she chimed in, strengthening their father’s case.
“Yes, your father’s right, you make me so sad that I could almost cry.”
Sofiya exaggerated her movements and the tone of her voice to pretend she
was quite serious.
Taking Sofiya seriously, Aleksi and his little brother Stassi
apologized. And from this opening moment, Lillya knew that these two
sweet boys would liven up her stay in France.

111

Lillya smiled and said hello, then followed her new handmaid Anika
up the stairs where a bath had been drawn and was waiting for her. The
water had been heated in big cauldrons over the fire and was mixed with ice
cold creek water from behind the house to get just the right temperature.
While she was bathing, Anika pulled out little sacks of lavender that she had
made in anticipation of Lillya’s arrival. After putting them in each of
Lillya’s drawers when she removed Lillya’s clothing from each of her
suitcases, she smiled with a look of great satisfaction, for this was the first
step towards helping Lillya not only speak French but smell French like all
the other girls in her class.
Lillya figured Anika was probably only ten years older than herself,
and even in her work clothes you could see she had a nice figure.
When speaking French, Anika’s vocabulary and the way she put her words
together – was far superior to her own facility with the language. Someone
had taken the time to educate her, for she spoke English and Russian, too.
Clearly Anika was more than a handmaid. “I could learn a few things from
these French girls, especially this one,” Lillya said to herself.
Lillya made it a part of her daily routine to ask Anika questions about
herself, such as if she was married or had a boyfriend. And Anika made a
point of teaching Lillya the finer points of escargot and duck cooked in plum

112

sauce, but mostly how to carry the scent of lavender wherever she went. At
night, Anika put out a bowl of lavender and little bags to the side, for Lillya
had become fond of making her own little bags, and if she didn’t get around
to it, Anika made certain there was one in each of Lillya’s drawers when she
woke up in the morning. “Now you’ll smell like a real French girl,” she
would smile, and Lillya couldn’t help but smile back.
Anika slowly introduced her to all of the different rooms in the house.
One sitting room with a big oak desk and stained-glass windows was
dedicated to the style of Peter Carl Fabergé, a Russian jeweler of French
descent. The decorator, unable to replicate the exact working of this famous
artist decided to make a wall clock and titled it “For Fabergé Time Will Tell
It All”. It reminded Lillya of St. Petersburg. The east wing of the chateau,
thought Lillya, is delightful. Father and I will live quite well here.
Though many miles from home, Anton became the picture Lillya saw
when she closed her eyes at night. Anton had something special, Lillya
wrote Natasha, and she imagined the crowd cheering as he tossed plates into
the air with each step he took. It sent chills down Lillya’s spine, but Lillya
had large ambitions of her own. She was a daring young woman, and boys
sought out the chance to catch a glimpse of this special girl.

113

Anton cursed his parents privately for sending him away just as he
was meeting the one girl that he thought could make him happy. There were
many boys who had much more to offer than Anton Vronsky, as far as
society was concerned, but Lillya’s fear of heights when she saw him at the
top of a rope made her want him more, for he had conquered her greatest
fear.
Lillya and her father would be gone a long time, and she wondered if
some other girl might capture his imagination in her absence. Natasha had
assured her that that would be impossible. “There’s no one more interesting
or talented than you!” and she believed it, so Lillya did, too.
And then there was the food. Escargot and pheasant and later the pear
tarts. How would she describe all of this to Natasha? Oh, how she wished
she could have come, too. How would she explain the temperament of the
people or why they serve so many courses in one meal? And breakfast, they
call it petit déjeuner. Why, according to Papa, there is nothing small about it.
Oh, thought Lillya, it’s so different!
With all this beauty, these exquisite luxuries, and delicious foods, it
doesn’t seem to keep the people from getting high-strung and having
passionate arguments in all their conversations right in the middle of dinner.

114

“Not because they are angry, but because they feel strongly about
something,” her father explained.
“They seem to have an uncanny internal clock to tell when the
raspberries and crème brûlée are about to be served, because they are always
smiling by the time dessert is in the air,” her father continued. “They don’t
seem to fight, really, they just value good, hearty conversation.”
There is much highly animated debate about everything from art and
music to science and politics among these educated people, but Papa seems
to be a pro at keeping up with this, she wrote in her first letter to Natasha
from France. They love hearing him talk. I think some of it has to do with his
Russian accent. He speaks French very well and is very well-versed in
poetry and language which he likes to show off and throw in. I think he
might be having too much fun already.
Sergei and his family have owned their chateau for several hundred
years. He and his wife are letting me ride one of their prize horses for the
duration of our stay. I can’t believe I have gone so long without talking
about this beautiful stallion named Whisper. I’ve been told he was given his
name because of the way he galloped down a path always quiet and smooth.
I like the sound of this English word and its translation, too.

115

In the Loire Valley, you could actually smell the land as it flew off his
hoofs. I’m going to explore some new trails with Papa and I’m sure I’m
going to have many adventures while I’m here.
Lillya began to imagine what the next months might bring and the
more she thought of the present, the smaller the past became. It’s not that
she loved Natasha a lesser amount, it was just that there were so many new
things around her to think about and the culture was so different that she
couldn’t help but get engaged.
Yuri and his friends sat in the library and drank and played cards at
night. Lillya was certain he was having a good time. I wonder what kind of
life he leads when we’re asleep at night in St. Petersburg,” she wrote
Natasha. “I think he’s too handsome and probably too full of life to have
kept to himself all these years. I wonder why I never gave him credit for
being more than a father. To me he’s just Papa. But for the first time, I’m
seeing that he’s more than that to others. And I guess it’s only in this land of
romance and passion that I can even think about my father in this way. It
just makes me question everyone, even myself.

116

Chapter 21
Kungur, June 1918
Lillya started to blink her eyes, but she wasn’t quite ready to get up.
She pulled her coat that had fallen off her during the night back on top of
her. It was a cheap but warm coat her husband had bought for her before
they left from one of the carneys who in return received a gift more than ten
times the coats monetary value. The carney didn’t ask Anton, why. He
simply knew not to turn his back on a good deal.
When Lillya woke up the next morning after their grand welcoming
celebration, thoughts of Perm and Natasha were floating in her head. She
knew that for now it was best to keep those thoughts to herself. These
people, whom she barely knew, were taking big risks in trying to keep her
and her husband out of grave danger. She couldn’t make any decisions
without thinking of their welfare first.
However, when she closed her eyes later that afternoon, the voices of
famous opera singers each reaching out with their mouths wide open, their
tongues relaxed, were singing their favorite arias in the direction of the city
of Perm where the relatively new Opera House lived. The trajectory of their
voices rose over the fields of smiling sunflowers turning with the sun. Lillya

117

smiled back at them. They gave her a route in which to escape for several
hours each day and music always brought her joy.
Lillya and Anton were welcomed by the congregation in Kungur in a
friendly, quiet sort of way. No one wanted to get too close or ask too many
questions. Everyone held the same belief, that the less they knew the better
off they would be. There were limits they all had silently agreed upon and it
was those limits that kept them safe. Less knowledge was the key to safety.
And Lillya didn’t mind, she actually appreciated having a little peace.
Anton, on the other hand, needed to keep himself busy, so he spent
most of his days helping Nikolai do construction work for those unable to
mend their houses themselves. Michael did not join them, instead he used
age and money to get himself out of the work he still felt he was above, but
he donated to the cause by buying many of the supplies they needed and
overseeing the finances of the church.
On random afternoons though, he would come and spend time with
Lillya. “Your mother had what they called a third eye. Did you know that?
She could see inside other people by focusing on it, or at least that is what
she told us, and it made our afternoons and evenings more entertaining. It
could have just been a perfectly placed mole on her forehead, but your
mother enjoyed being exotic, so we all believed it, because then it made our

118

knowing her more exotic, too. Your mother’s family had an Indian woman
as a caretaker and your mother loved to get lost in the many imaginative
stories she shared. When she was eight, her parents took her to Thailand.
She must have told you this story. All she could talk about when she
returned home was how she rode an elephant whose name was Namaste.”
“Yes, I do remember that story, for when I was six, she gave me a
painting of an elephant she said looked just like the one that she had met.
She swore it could have been Namaste’s twin. My mother added a third eye
to the painting of this elephant so that he could watch over me when she was
no longer at home.”
For a moment Lillya drifted some place far, far away in the past, but
then she remembered her father’s journal and the mystery she was trying to
solve and knew she had work to do and she came back to life. Lillya
understood, for she was targeted in a similar yet different way. Lillya had a
mole on her back shaped like a heart, that always marked her as different
and set her apart.
***
They had been in Kungur for about three weeks. Lillya was losing
track. Now that they were in one spot, Anton quit making the marks on his
stick to keep track of the days, and they were settling in. The three couples

119

spent most of their time together and liked to joke about that first awkward
evening, their celebration, and getting to know one another. They recalled
the table on which they dined had vases full of wildflowers, each vase more
colorful than the one before it. Anton had made certain to pick only flowers
that he thought would please his wife.
Michael brought with him their very best bottle of wine and a bottle of
vodka he had been saving that had once lived in the cellar of the Tsar
Nicholas I, Michael liked to think that its scent could make its way across
the Ural Mountain range as the Tsar sat down to dinner with his wife and
children. The thought of this, even for a fleeting moment, gave him hope
that the world he had known still had some life. They toasted the Tsar and
his family in soft tones to be certain the neighbors or anyone passing by
could not hear them. He hoped that at least a whiff of its scent would
somehow find its way across the Ural Mountain range to Ekaterinburg where
Tsar Nicholas II and his family had been taken as prisoners. Michael liked to
think that when he opened the bottle and toasted the Tsar and his family, that
somehow the Tsar and his children would feel less alone. But everything had
to have a sense of discretion, for fear of the unknown and what their
neighbors really thought and believed.

120

Gretta brought a casserole with potatoes, carrots and chunks of good
beef. Nikolai’s wife made special cookies that were sweetened with honey
and cinnamon and a hint of cardamom. Best of all, they brought to the party
their true selves, which they felt safe to display. Even if it wasn’t wise to do
so, they needed to let go of their fear. The alcohol and the sweets had created
a dreamlike quality, one that she hadn’t experienced since leaving her father.
They had had to wear worry as if it were an overcoat. She started to relax
and said a silent prayer, recognizing how much better off they were from the
majority of people, for there were many, many who were suffering.
Nikolai and his wife did their best to be good hosts. It was hard to be
discreet. This was a reunion, a special occasion.
There had been so much planning and preparation for Anton and
Lillya’s arrival that it was hard not to be giddy and full of laughter. A
familiarity swept through the air. You would never have believed that they
were just getting to know one another or get reacquainted. If you had passed
by the carriage house that night, you would have thought they were exactly
who they were portraying themselves to be, old friends and relatives.
Michael pulled out another bottle of wine. Lillya almost felt at home
when she saw the label. Her father had that exact same bottle. She wondered
if Michael knew it and was silently making a toast to him and St. Petersburg.

121

Just for that act alone, if the wrong person had seen it, it could probably have
meant imprisonment. But instead of drinking the wine in hand-cut crystal
glasses, they drank it in mugs that were used for cheap beer, then Michael
quickly hid the empty bottle and pulled out an empty bottle of beer that
could be lying on the table should someone unexpected appear. The more
they drank, savoring these delicate tastes, the happier the clan became. For
no one knew from one minute to the next what their life would be like, so
they had to learn to appreciate every good moment that came and not take
anything for granted.

The next morning, it was announced in the town square and all the
churches that Tsar Nicholas II was dead. No more information was provided,
but everyone knew that he had been killed by the Reds who were holding
him captive. Their world had irrevocably changed. There was no longer any
hope that things would return to the normal Russians had known for
centuries. A deep sadness permeated the air, but they could only weep in
private. Anton and Lillya prayed for the Tsar, his wife and children.

122

Chapter 22

Cadre Noir, Saumur, France, June 1886
Hervé Laurent Fleury was a plain sort of fellow who had worked all
his life to make himself big. If he were given a lesson that would normally
take two hours, he would take four to six hours of study to make certain
when called upon his answer would be perfect. His dress was always
impeccable, and he studied the dictionary so in conversation he could throw
out a word or two to display his intelligence and aptitude.
Laurent, as most people called him, also loved horses and he worked
just as hard to become a master at that as he did with everything else. When
he wasn’t studying to perfect his person or appearance, he was at the chateau
of a captain at the Cadre Noir who had discovered this overachiever of a boy
in an orphanage nearby and decided he would be a very good worker.
There was never a son and fatherly relationship among the two, but a deep
respect of each one’s skill when it came to horses, and so the man kept
Laurent on and clothed him and fed him and one day suddenly surprised him
with a scholarship to the famed academy.
Laurent took this opportunity like he took everything else; seriously,
and thus he rose in the ranks until it was clear that one day, he would equal
his patron savior. However, one day while training the horses, his patron

123

savior had a heart attack and died, leaving Laurent nothing but himself and
his position at the academy, for which he was grateful. Year after year,
Laurent perfected his craft and showed a very bright future ahead of him.
The only thing missing was love and a wife. Then one day, while riding in
the woods near the creek, he saw a streak of lightning ride past him. Then he
saw it ride past him again, in the opposite direction.
Not certain what it was, he planned to return to the exact same spot at
the exact same time the following day just in case the mystery event would
repeat itself once more. Being the kind of person who left little up to chance,
he observed his surroundings like any good soldier would. He noted to his
left stood a large tree that had been damaged in a recent storm and behind it
a patch of beautiful wild roses that had found a home amongst the
dandelions and brush. But the greatest impression of all was the scent of the
flowers that lingered in the air and the sound of the water rushing behind
him.
The next morning when he returned, a beautiful girl with flaming red
hair and emerald eyes, dressed in gold and red silks standing upright on a
horse’s back flew past him with a gigantic smile on her face. She blew him a
kiss. Laurent almost fell off his horse!

124

“She’s the most wondrous creature I’ve ever seen,” he moaned to
himself. “I must meet her,” he exclaimed.
Having to work overtime, which for years had been no problem for
him, that weekend Laurent sadly went to do his duty and fulfill his
obligation at the academy. He had been given the job of showing yet another
wealthy man around the academy. “Don’t they see enough horses?”
Laurent sighed to himself out of fear that if he didn’t return to that
exact spot this morning the girl would think that he wasn’t interested, which
could not have been further from the truth. Still, he took pride in his work
and appearance for by now it was who he had become. But when the
wealthy man arrived, a man from the academy approached Laurent to let
him know that the man had brought his daughter. “He says she is very
interested in riding, so you might need to slow your pace and cater it a bit
toward her as I believe that is what would make this man happy.”
Just at that moment, a swirling girl dressed in yellow, gold, and red
entered the stable with her father.
“This is Yuri Engelhardt and his daughter, Lillya.” The squint in
Laurent’s eye, examining if what he was seeing was the truth, could have
told one hundred tales. Every fantasy that he had ever had, seemed to come
real when he saw this girl.

125

Laurent took several breaths, then escorted Yuri and Lillya into the
menage where stood some of the most beautiful horses Lillya had ever seen -
Thoroughbreds, Anglo-Arabians, Hanoverians and Selle Francais –
variously muscular and wiry, warm and cold but never sluggish or timid.
Although the cadet was very distinguished looking, he seemed a bit tongue-
tied at first until he began to display the very French upper crust form of
horse ballet of which he was a master.
Lillya’s father whispered to her, telling her that very few horsemen
around the world knew this special art as well as this cadet did. Laurent
knew that this was his time to shine. The girl certainly would be captivated
and would have difficulty keeping her eyes on anyone or anything else other
than him. “Thank you, father,” Lillya whispered back to Yuri. “Coming here
has been worth it, if only for this.”
Yuri, feeling quite pleased with himself, asked the cadet if he would
like to come over to the chateau where they were staying and go riding with
him and his daughter sometime soon.
Laurent could not believe how lucky he was to have been the one
chosen to give Yuri and Lillya the tour, and he quickly obliged. The rest of
the day, Laurent could do nothing but brag, which was not his usual custom.

126

“Did you see that girl?” he asked every cadet he could talk to.  “She’s going
to be my wife,” he repeated over and over.
Lillya, when she got back to the chateau, immediately ran to the
stables of their neighbor and took out Whisper. “You are going to learn
some special tricks this summer,” she smiled.
For the rest of the afternoon, until almost sunset, Lillya schooled the
horse until Yuri made her come back inside. “I’m going to see Laurent, and
you can’t say no, Papa.” And he knew she was right. “He’s going to teach
me this secret art of horse ballet that very few men know. Just think what the
aristocratic women will do when I show them this!” Yuri didn’t want to
think about it because his daughter was a force to be reckoned with when
she made up her mind. Lillya could barely contain her excitement.
She had first learned of the fine art of dressage four years earlier and
had actually seen a master once with her father when he took her with him to
pick out a horse. There was a Frenchman in St. Petersburg with a beautiful
stallion the color of chestnut who had been taught this almost sacred art.
Lillya knew how privileged she was to have been able to tag along with her
father and she knew better than to pester him or his invitation would vanish
as quickly as it had appeared.

127

“You will look, listen, and observe and be quiet,” her father said, “and
nothing more. Are you able to do that? For several days before their visit,
she practiced the art of silence, the most important and difficult one for her,
and satisfied her father’s requirements. She was completely enthralled by the
astonishingly delicate and precise command this rider had of his horse, and
the trust the horse would put in his rider.
So, when the opportunity with Laurent came along, Lillya felt that she
was more than ready to be schooled in this art and by this time she had
become a masterful rider herself.
“Don’t get too serious with this Laurent,” her father said after several
days. And then he reminded her that she was in France to perfect her French
and to get to know lots of French girls and boys, not just one.
“Don’t worry, Papa. He doesn’t think of me in that way. Besides he’s
very polite and has never tried to force himself on me.” But Yuri knew men
and he knew that they didn’t always say what they truly thought.
“You know that I’ve gone to all the dances I’ve been invited to, and
when I get home, I’m going to set my intentions on Anton Vronsky.” Lillya
liked to get her father all riled up. But it was true for Lillya. Ever since
meeting Anton, she could think of no future better or brighter than being in a
circus, and she had never met a boy more exotic or kind.

128

“No, father, no worries about me staying in France or falling in love
with Laurent. That would put me a sea and an ocean away from you and the
man I will one day marry. I couldn’t bear being away from the two of you,
let alone Natasha! I like him very well, but he’s not the one for me, you’ll
see.” And she said goodnight, thinking about Anton while counting her
horse’s steps because, if she could, she wanted to do this art as perfectly as
Anton did his.

129

Chapter 23
Kungur, August 1918
Michael’s work-shed, and the parish’s, too, kept more than shovels
and gardening tools. Sometimes Gretta would ask him what he was doing
out there, and he would answer, “Just thinking of you, my dear.”
Each spring, Michael planted a special flower to represent the
qualities he found endearing and beautiful in his wife. How bright and shiny
they made everything else appear around them. He had grown sunflowers
that summer because of their beauty and openness, and how they seemed to
always welcome anyone who looked at them.
Michael knew that bringing Lillya and Anton to Kungur would
ultimately be hard on his wife, Gretta, but he owed this to Yuri. He was
repaying an old debt, one long overdue. The couple’s presence here,
unbeknownst to the others, meant Gretta must find a way to be welcoming
and generous even though it would cause her pain they could not know.
Lillya and Anton quickly settled into their new lives in Kungur. Anton
assisted the priest with construction tasks while Lillya caught up with
Michael.
The three couples spent time together, drinking, playing games,
singing, etc. Michael brought over a new deck of plain playing cards,

130

nothing fancy or prestigious like the Chas Goodall and Sons cards he and
Yuri used to carry in their back pockets most everywhere. He thought it
would help them pass the time while doing something fun and familiar.
Seeing them, Anton couldn’t help but reminisce about having taught his son
Vladimir to play the games Preferans and Durak and how much he loved
them. Many rainy-day afternoons of Vladimir’s childhood had been spent
playing cards with his father. Sometimes Lillya would join them. Those
were happy times.
Anton’s memories hung like clouds over his head. He missed his son
terribly the eight years since they had sent him and their circus off to
America. But as he laid out four queens, he reminded himself that all of
those who fled Russia in time had been saved from this suffering! His
queens, his granddaughters Ann Marie Heart, Spade, Diamond Claire and
Lucky Club, his son Vladimir and his daughter-in-law, Bella were safe and
did not have to deal with this craziness.
Lillya could see Anton going someplace far away and nudged him as
they were in the middle of a game and not alone. She did not begrudge him
these thoughts, though sometimes she was jealous. Anton could see the past
so clearly at times she wished that she could jump inside his head and live
there.

131

Gretta had brought over a pie that was filled with meat and vegetables
that they would eat later. This was a time they had dedicated to fun and
frivolity as the rest was mostly filled with work and worry. Even Nikolai
joined them and played cards. He had deemed them a blessing as they
helped to take his fears and worries and put them someplace merry. It was
seldom that laughter was heard except during these special nights and hours.
Why, just the day before Red sympathizers had come into the church and
were notating the names of those who were praying. Nikolai pretended to be
busy cleaning the altar and just nodded his head trying not to engage in
conversation. This time it worked.
Lillya loved to see how each of them looked with a smile on their
face. She could imagine them that way when they were young, how they
must have looked in better days.
Lillya recognized that she had become a master of disguise. If her
years had taught her anything, it was how to look like someone else.
However, it wasn’t so hard to do now as these days she barely recognized
herself. When she saw her reflection in the nearby creek, hardship, time, and
sadness stared back at her. They had taken their toll. The wrinkles on her
face had dug in deeper and made a permanent home. She named the most
pronounced ones after female mythological characters. One she dubbed

132

Athena, for her intelligence and wisdom, another Demeter, for her power
over food and plants and her connection to the underworld. The deepest
crease became Aphrodite, because it was her memories of love that
sustained her. Accompanied by these goddesses and great determination, she
found the strength each day to keep on living.
Lillya was a secret night owl. Most nights she stayed up late, long past
the time Anton fell asleep, so she could sneak into her father’s journal and
learn more about him, his thoughts and their family. During the day she
usually did things with Helena and Gretta. She was easily accepted by those
she met, but she had disguised herself in this instance as a woman who
spoke very little and was not very sociable with others. She had put up a
fence the parishioners felt kept out everyone but Gretta and Helena. It’s not
that she didn’t like the others or that they disliked her, she had built a wall
around herself because she knew, if she started talking in easy conversation
her disguise would be peeled away.
After a few months, she felt an odd sense of security. She found peace
in not running. The familiar routine of each day wore her down and left her
quiet. But the candle that had burned so brightly all these years now seemed
dim and she was having trouble finding her way and figuring out what she
still believed in. She wondered about her father. She imagined he had

133

become as fragile as a piece of old parchment paper, that if not carefully
treated would crumble and vanish. Truthfully, in her heart she believed he
was probably dead, for in a way, she had always thought it was her who kept
him alive. She gave him his raison de etre2.
Lillya did everything she could to keep her business at home and not
to go out in search of anyone. She worked at making the cottage house
comfortable, and the flowers Anton brought her each day helped. She only
hoped he wasn’t taking them from other people’s gardens. She understood
how important a particular flower might be to someone.
Lillya was dying for a fast stallion to ride, one that she could hoot and
holler from and be truly free, but she let Anton represent them. After all, he
had spent a lifetime entertaining people and was highly qualified. They kept
their circus skills to themselves to protect their identities, not wanting to jar
loose any memories, for lots of people went to the circus yearly and they
knew Anton and Lillya’s history.
Gretta stopped by most mornings with a special treat, and Lillya
would unwrap the treat while Gretta watched her. She loved the way Lillya
wore happiness on her face.

2 Reason to exist

134

Gretta was finding it hard to dislike Lillya. They both loved music,
and Gretta often came in the morning with her fiddle in hand. They would
sing old Russian folk songs such as Korobeiniki to each other. Sometimes
they discovered the harmonies in a song and that always brought them closer
together, like it or not.
About once a week they would create competitions just to keep their
brains active and to challenge the others. Nikolai’s wife Helena usually
could outpace all of them. One musical game was often played when all six
of them were together. They put pieces of wood each marked with a letter of
the alphabet into a bowl and every person would pull one out. Then their
partner would be their secretary as they proceeded to name every song that
they could think of whose title began with that letter. Whoever named the
most got to choose which songs they would have to sing. So, then they sang
and laughed and whoever got the most points got a bottle of Michael’s finest
vodka and if Michael and Gretta won, they would be owed a present from
either Lillya or Helena that they had hand-stitched, such as a pretty wall
hanging, initials on their socks, etc.  There were always good presents to be
had.
Lillya found Helena to be reliable and Gretta good entertainment and
well-cultured. By the time Gretta and Helena left for the day, Lillya knew

135

she had about thirty minutes, if she hurried, to peek into her father’s old
journal, for soon Anton would be home. The one thing she valued during
these days in Kungur was, yes, the company of these two women. She had
been able to lay her worry out on the table and bake it into a pie or a cake
and make something sweet out of something sour and distasteful.
Angelika was not always the angel she appeared to be, her father
wrote, but at the time we met she was everything I wanted. She loved horses
and animals, and it was clear she had the ability to tuck away her wilder
side for the people and things she found to be important. I never dreamed
she would get so sick, but how she loved our Lillya more than herself. Her
world revolved around that child.
Lillya didn’t read her father’s journal in any sort of chronological
order. Some days she read a portion from his memories of the past and other
days she read a portion that he wrote while it was happening in the present
tense. One day after Gretta and Helena left, she pulled up something quite
unexpected.
Still there is something I need to share with her. We don’t like to keep
secrets from one another, and I have a big one that I am holding from her
about my cousin Michael.

Chapter 24
Saumur, France, August 1886
Since coming to France, Lillya had gotten into the habit of borrowing
their host’s stallion every morning. She also got into the habit of seeing
Laurent daily. She was surprised to discover in herself that there was
something about the French that made her feel free and all warm inside and
it wasn’t just because she was living in the middle of a vineyard or that her
father let her sip wine at meals as she watched the others drink by the carafe.
Lillya felt French passion seemed to be a happier passion than the daunting
sadness depicted in most Russian stories, paintings, music, dance and
poems. It made her want to be freer, and sometimes with Laurent she found
herself becoming someone else, a girl less shy and more expressive than the
girl she had been all of her life.
Yes, she still rode like lightning and could light up the nighttime sky,
and there were many from the opposite sex both old and young taken by her,
but she had held herself back. When she was with Laurent, she could see in
his eyes that he was falling deeply in love with her without telling her or
expressing any words. Lillya began to frighten herself, for in this foreign
world she was beginning to feel this way, too. Then one evening, as he
helped her off her horse, his hands got tangled in the garlands in her hair and

137

as he gently pulled them out, he found his hands lightly touching her face
and surprising not only her, he leaned in and kissed her. Then he pulled back
and looked into her eyes and could see that she liked it and wanting her so
badly he did it again, only this time for twice as long. “Will you be mine?”
he asked her. “We can spend our lives riding through the breeze and dancing
on the shore. I promise you will be happy for it is all that I want in this
world.”
Lillya was shocked and excited at the same time. No man had ever
spoken to her like a grown woman before. So enamored by the moment was
she, she sighed, “Yes my love, yes, yes!” But by the time the second “Yes,”
slipped off her tongue, Lillya could already feel the gravity of her actions
and yet she was conflicted by how excited she felt inside. And Laurent,
hearing her breathe and putting his hand on her chest to make certain that the
pounding heartbeat was hers, went from a knight to becoming a king, for the
young woman he just kissed could be nothing less than a queen.
When they left to part their separate ways home, he kissed her again;
just long enough and hard enough to make her question herself and she left
him dizzy and confused.
When she returned to the chateau, her handmaid could tell something
was wrong just in the way Lillya was avoiding her father. She immediately

138

asked for a bath, almost demanded it, as if she wanted to wipe something off
of her. The handmaid, trying to be nice to Lillya, instead made her cry.
“Pourquoi pleurez-vous? Dites-moi3,” she asked. And she spilled her
story of her infatuation with Anton and her embarrassment of getting carried
away with Laurent.
“How will I ever be able to explain this to the man I believe to be my
true love? He pulled out this blue velvet box before I left, and he slipped it
into my own pocket. I didn’t know what to do. It all happened so fast.” And
Lillya began to cry even more.
“I’m afraid to open it myself. Will you stay here while I do?” and her
handmaid nodded a yes reply with her head.
Unbeknownst to them both, Yuri had followed Lillya in, and when he
could hear that she was upset, he stayed outside her door and listened to her
as she cried her heart out. Wishing he could wrap his arms around her like
he did when she was a little girl, instead he did the only thing he felt a good
father could do. He walked next door, apologized for pulling Sergei from his
dinner and they went into the library where they could have some privacy,
and they talked father to father.

3 Why are you crying? Tell me

139

Yuri said not a word to Lillya and better than that, he asked no
questions. He did what he felt he should do to not throw dirt on either the
young man or his young daughter. But as the morning sun began to peep its
head through the panes in Lillya’s bedroom, a groggy headed young woman
was put into a carriage with big feather pillows where she was served
breakfast dumplings as her father said his goodbyes to Sergei and they
pulled away as suddenly as they had arrived. Soon they would be in Paris
and on a train to St. Petersburg as if they had never gone.
Lillya didn’t train with Laurent again, but she remembered the many
mornings and teachings he had so freely given. She pictured herself on top
of Sergei’s horse Whisper, and in her head went over the ballet step by step
that Laurent had taught her, because even in her present state of mind, she
was not so far gone to not see its value in her world.
On the long trip home, she reopened the box that Laurent had so
gently put in her pocket several days before. She looked awkwardly at an
ornate old emerald brooch and again read with discomfort the note. To the
flame of my life who sparkles brighter than the emerald in this brooch. May
this always be yours and you be mine.

140

Chapter 25
Kungur, August 1918
Lillya just about dropped the journal. Wanting to do nothing other
than read this book, she was quite disappointed when she heard the sound of
Nikolai’s wife getting closer.
Nikolai’s wife had been very kind and did everything she could to
endear herself to Lillya and bait her into telling stories of the past. Lillya,
wanting friendship and a conversation, became easy prey. She even told
Helena about a boy she met in France when she was a girl and how he taught
her the art of dressage and how that simple act of teacher and student
changed her life, and that of the circus, too.
Lillya could hear Helena’s footsteps getting closer. Lillya knew she
had to tuck the journal away for now and hope it didn’t get found between
now and the next time she would have a chance to look at it. She found it
interesting that the parish priest and his wife had put so much of their lives at
stake for complete strangers. She was grateful, but still found it worrisome.
“Don’t priests do good deeds?” she asked herself, trying to figure out each
person’s motives. But as she read more of her father’s journal, she began to
realize that Michael didn’t just like her mother, she was beginning to think
he loved her mother and had hoped it would be himself who married her.

141

Lillya was beginning to believe that love was moving Michael forward, and
after a while she understood the confusion that Gretta felt as she put it all
together. What motivated Helena, or did she just get pulled into this like an
object in a storm that gets blown away and then has to make where they
land their new home?
Lillya quickly stuffed the journal in her bag. She wondered, too. She
understood Michael wanting to help his cousin and his cousin’s daughter,
but she wasn’t quite so certain of what drove Helena; wasn’t so certain of
her motives, and she felt horrible for having those thoughts about someone
who’d been so good to her and was probably saving her life. Luckily that
day, Helena had just come to drop off a shawl she had finished knitting. “I
made this for you, Lillya. I found the perfect emerald green threads and yarn
to put together something I think is perfect for you. It will keep you warm on
chilly evenings and if it’s too heavy to carry when you depart, you can just
leave it here and we’ll get it to you another time, in better times, I hope.
Perhaps I’ll be able to see that wonderful estate Michael has talked about so
often and ride one of your stallions.”
Lillya was taken aback by the shawl’s beauty. Some of her favorite
colors: teal, blood orange and yellow gold. Helena asked Lillya if she would
want to go to the river with her. “I find it calming, and I am able to

142

daydream and imagine what it was like for us before all of this craziness. We
don't have to stay long, just long enough to feel good and let the river run
through our bodies.” And they both laughed.
“Do you think that will happen before I die?” laughed Lillya.
She hadn’t wandered too far away since they arrived. All those days
of walking mile after mile had made her feet and legs sore from all the effort
she had put out. But without Anton looking out for her, she was not
confident in Helena’s ability to provide safety, so she made up an excuse;
that she was writing a journal of her escapades. “One day I will share these
stories with you and maybe the world,” she smiled. “Maybe another day. I
love the water and how calm and free it makes me feel.”
Helena left, but not before leaving a watermelon and a few pears
behind, all prized gifts in Kungur. Lillya looked at the clock. She saw she
had just a little more time to read and wanted to put it to good use, so back to
her father’s journal she went and this time she turned to a page at random.
Surprisingly Michael’s name was right at the top.
From Yuri’s journal:
Michael might be getting himself into trouble.
Michael has met someone; a woman I should say, and he can’t seem
to get her out of his mind. He thinks about her all day every day. Angelika

143

says she can only bring complications and trouble to him and our family.
She is upset with him, which he can hardly bear. It’s Angelika’s handmaid,
and she says he’s doing this to make her jealous. He’s come up with tricks
so he can find himself alone with this woman. I knew that it would not last so
long, but you can’t blame the girl wanting to better her situation. Today the
woman told him she was pregnant. She’s a smart one, too, she made a point
of telling him in the place where she knew Angelika would be able to
overhear their conversation. Of course, she knew Angelika couldn’t leave
her handmaid’s fate and that of a baby’s in only Michael’s hands to figure
out himself.
Angelika and Michael had always had a special bond, but Yuri had
always believed that Michael did not deserve Angelika the way that he did.
From the time they were children, Michael and Yuri had been thrown
together, being close in age when they attended family functions and had
remained competitive throughout their lives even when playing games. But
in reality, nothing was ever really a game to them, it was always who could
do it better. In Michael’s eyes, Yuri had ultimately won the jackpot – the
prize of all prizes. He had only been with this other woman to try to make
Angelika jealous, but it hadn’t worked.

144

He’s my best friend, I can’t not help him, Yuri wrote in his journal.
But how? What do I do to make things right for all involved? But that
seemed like an impossible mission.
The handmaid, Sonya Palitov, was sent to the house of another distant
cousin in St. Petersburg where she stayed in hiding until she gave birth.
Then they would deal with what would be done next. But when Angelika
and Yuri saw the child for the first time, and when they held her in their
arms and saw her sparkly eyes squinting and smiling back at them, and that
Englehardt nose and chin, they knew this child had to be kept close. They
couldn’t betray the secret of her birth or who her birth parents were. It would
have brought too much pain and embarrassment down on her and the rest of
the family and she would have been mocked and teased and set up with bad
marks before her little life began.
At least she should have a chance to make her own way without the
burden of being a bastard. We held her in our arms and then Michael saw
her too, it was clear we couldn’t just give her to anyone. ‘She’s family,’
Angelika reminded all of us. So, I found myself a key player right in the thick
of their scheme; one that came out of good intentions but would one day
blow up like a cannon in our faces. Angelika called it ‘the best answer to a
bad situation.’

145

I know Lillya, if you are reading this now, you are more than curious,
you are also furious that I could have kept this from you for so long. I’m
sorry, but I swore to your mother and your cousin Michael that I would
never say a word. The baby’s mother was set up in Perm where she was only
expected to do light housework as she was nursing. When the little girl
turned three, it was decided she would come to me, and I would be her
unknown guardian and caretaker.
Although anxious and curious to see the name of this girl and to see if
she knew her, all that Lillya had absorbed had left her very tired and as
much as she wanted to continue, she found that she could not read another
word. Tonight, what she wanted most was a good sleep. She had dug deep
enough for one day. The rest would have to wait. Besides, if she did not
come to bed soon, Anton would get worried.

146

Chapter 26
Returning by train from France, August 1886
Lillya saw the rest of France mostly from the window of the train. Her
father had gathered her so quickly, she had no time to put her thoughts
together. He had already made the decisions for her. All Lillya wanted was
to be in the loving arms of her best friend, but she didn’t know if she could
face her. She had made so many mistakes. She worried, what must Laurent
think? I never meant to hurt him this way. How will I explain this to Anton
when I get home, or get the words out to tell Natasha the truth?
Lillya lay in solitude on the long, expensive journey back to St.
Petersburg. She didn’t know what to say and she wasn’t interested in much
of anything, even the wonderful food laid in front of her, not even her
favorite desserts. Her father tried to bait her with profiteroles and Poire Belle
Hélène, but even that was useless. He couldn’t get that saddened look off her
face. She carried a book with her everywhere and used it as a prop when she
sat down so others would think she was occupied and unavailable for
conversation. All day and night long she stared at the clouds or the passing
landscapes absorbing nothing but her thoughts and her days in the Loire
Valley and Laurent.

147

Yuri was disappointed that the trip of a lifetime he had planned for his
daughter fell so flat. A steamship from St. Petersburg to Bordeaux and then
on the way back, a first-class train with four days in Paris; museums and
dining, the Champs-Elysées. Four days in Paris had turned into one. He had
never seen his daughter so upset. His daughter was mixed-up and confused
and Yuri blamed himself for not watching over her more carefully and
getting too caught up in his own world.
Lillya cried, off and on, the entire way to St. Petersburg and upon her
return Yuri had the difficult task of explaining that Natasha’s mother had
taken a new position in Odessa and Natasha had gone with her. He
concealed his own role in this and had secretly burned the letters Natasha
had sent to Lillya in France as well Lillya’s own long letters to Natasha. He
blamed the international postal service for her lack of a response from
Natasha.
Would she ever see Natasha again? Lillya was furious and despairing.
She accepted no visitors. She asked an old handmaid to draw her baths, one
that she knew would never have the nerve to ask her questions about herself.
Then one day, when they had been home for a week, Lillya called no
one and went into her closet and dressed herself. She then went to the stables
alone and picked out the horse she thought would be best. She groomed and

148

primped the handsome stallion, was very meticulous with her actions and
whispered to him the entire time. Soon the horse was rubbing his nose
against her chest and making happy whinnying sounds. She did this three
mornings in a row and by the end of the third day it was as if Lillya and the
stallion had become forged as one. Everyone was interested but no one
interfered with her ritual they just waited; her father, the maids, the stable
boys all curious to see where it would go, what Lillya had in mind. “At least
she’s doing something,” her father said to everyone. Anton, somewhat hurt
by Lillya’s actions, felt as if he had been pushed aside and was puzzled. He
gave no answer to Yuri’s comment, he just nodded.
Each morning, they waited to see what she would do next. On the
fourth morning, she saddled the stallion her father called Bruno, the one she
felt could listen and understand her wishes. By now they were bonded, and
he was sensitive to her voice and movement. She grabbed his reins, jumped
on the horse and asked the stable boy to open the gate. She gave the horse a
swift kick and off they went.
Lillya told the horse all she had to say. She rode him hard and fast and
soft and gentle, pouring out not only what was on her mind, but where she
expected to go and what she hoped they would accomplish together. And
when they returned to the stables, she brought the stallion back out to the

149

rink and she walked with him, letting him cool down as she continued
talking to him in a low, calm voice. Later, she told Yuri that she was just
explaining to him what they were going to do and what would be expected
of him.
Yuri didn’t want to imagine what could have occurred to have put
Lillya in this state, but in this particular moment she seemed cool and at
home with herself. Lillya knew what she was meant to do.
Her father Yuri told everyone to leave her alone. “She’s fine. She’s
just in an inward state of mind making major life decisions. Everyone
deserves that, don’t you think? Let her be.” And they all did.
Two weeks later, Lillya called to her father from outside the stable
and asked him to join her. “Papa! I want to show you something!” Surprised
by now to hear her voice asking for his attention, this caught him a little off
guard. As he walked toward his daughter, he thought about how she had
spent weeks hidden away in her room and at one point had gone to the
extreme of having her food left by her door. She even drew her own bath
and dried her own self off.
“I’m coming,” Yuri replied. Suddenly, as Yuri got closer to the rink, a
bell went off and things began to make sense. Intuitively, he knew what his
daughter had been doing. Moments later he saw it with his own two eyes,

150

and what had started out as a small grin turned into a gigantic smile on his
face. His daughter was sitting on top of Bruno, gracefully going through the
horse ballet exercises that Laurent had taught her. Then she built upon them
to do things Laurent could not have imagined – to a rhythm and stride of her
own counting and concluded by commanding movements from the standing
position. Who had ever seen or even imagined this!
Alone in the rink, Yuri started to clap and shout bravo and gave his
daughter a rousing standing ovation that he realized she would soon have to
get used to.
“My daughter is probably the only young woman in all of Russia who
has mastered the secret art of dressage.” Yuri picked her up and swung her
in his arms. The odd comment Lillya had made in France circled amid the
thoughts that were now chirping in his head. Can you imagine what the
aristocratic ladies of St. Petersburg will do with this, Lillya had said. And
for the first time in a month, he saw his daughter happy and content.
Lillya suddenly had an appetite. “I’m starving!” She smiled. “Let’s go
eat some breakfast.” She broke out in a huge Englehardt grin that practically
took over her entire face and it reminded Yuri of his love and admiration for
his daughter.

151

“That was an amazing trip that I will never forget,” she told her father.
“Do you think Agnes could draw me a bath?”

152

Chapter 27
Kungur, August 1918
From the journal, “The baby was smart and alert and seemed to be
able to mimic perfectly whatever Michael or I would do. Angelika also
wanted the baby to be taken care of and not just given to anyone, so she
approved of Michael letting this woman and her child live in our house in
Perm until the baby got older. However, the more days she spent in our
presence, the more attached we all became, and so I vowed to myself that I
would set up a situation where the handmaid and this baby could remain
together and with us. I don’t know how we came up with the name, I don’t
remember what it meant to Michael or the handmaid, perhaps because she
had been born in the Christmas season, but we began to call her Natasha. If
ever my daughter Lillya reads this, she will be both angry and pleased at the
same time, for her best friend is truly her cousin, but the child stands a
chance at a better life if no one knows this, otherwise she would just be
thought of as the bastard. If we had made this public simply for spite,
Michael would have lost everything, especially his wife Gretta to whom at
the time he was engaged. Gretta had already gone through the difficulty in
accepting that her soon to be husband had always wished that Angelika was
his. Now he had a child with her maid. In order to make peace and not cause

153

a huge family scandal or bring shame on an innocent child, Michael asked
me for a favor, and I could not say no!”
Lillya was shaken, almost going into spasms. Here she was, an older
woman – a grandmother herself, and she had never known this. How could
my father have done such a thing and not told me? That must be the secret
my father’s been keeping all these years! Lillya became so agitated she was
like a hot air balloon full of extremely intense emotions and about to burst.
She wanted to pick things up and break them, she was so angry. All the
years she had spent with her father and Natasha and been kept completely in
the dark. This was humiliating. I wonder if Natasha knew? she said to
herself. How could they have done this to me? How could they have done
this to her? Propriety? What does that even mean? What sort of promises do
you keep for a lie, and why? I hate them in this moment, Lillya thought to
herself. Oh, this caste system has caused too much pain and suffering and is
not of any use. She tucked the journal back into her bag and cried herself to
sleep until Anton came back to the carriage house later that same day.
Lillya and Anton spoke silently to each other as they had to address
what Lillya had discovered. How were they going to deal with the truth
about Natasha and her heritage? Right now, they both had to agree that
Natasha was kept safer by not being associated with them. But, oh, how

154

Lillya wanted to scream, “She’s my cousin and she deserves much more!”
But did either of them deserve more? The Reds would disagree. If they had
not, Lillya and Anton would not have to be hiding and fearful of their lives,
their destiny, their future.
Sometimes, the Red sympathizers would find a way inside Nikolai’s
church checking to see if he performed a service that was nonreligious and
looked away from God. Then, by contrast, the men who believed and fought
for the opposite side were fighting to hold onto their wealth while the other
men’s families were starving. It was a complex time. The lines were formed
and drawn. It seemed as if it should be easy to decide where one stood, but
nothing was easy, because as they each gained a little something, they each
lost as much as well. Lillya got shivers up and down her spine every time the
Bolsheviks came to torment them, thinking that we were just followers of
God and, if we had to choose between White and Red, Red would obviously
be chosen. But Lillya didn’t really feel like they had a choice. They were all
born into a certain lineage. It was frightening. Lillya would hear stories from
friends about how one’s sister or brother had been kidnapped in the night
and sent to the front lines, forced to battle their brothers or fathers on the
other side. But the six of them kept on, the women by now were more like
sisters – sisters who loved and argued. They didn’t necessarily agree with

155

one another all the time, but they knew to save themselves. Each of them
was needed in their own way.

156

Chapter 28
Yuri’s estate, October 1886
Lillya spent her time being very solitary those first months after she
returned from France. Anton was beside himself with frustration. He had
counted on a lot of things, but not this and not with Lillya. He wrote her
notes and called upon her father asking if he might have the pleasure of her
company. He hoped her father could be more persuasive, but he got the same
answer as the rest of the boys and friends had gotten. Lillya, simply put, had
her father tell everyone that she was engaged in a project that required all of
her attention, but it would not last forever and to Anton she had her father
add that she would be free soon and she looked forward to seeing him.
Finding it almost unbearable to have Lillya so close but at the same
time so distant, Anton left flowers daily by her door and short notes to not
take up too much of her time and he let her know how much he missed her.
Still, as difficult as it was for him, he had been trained since childhood to be
a patient man and his life in the circus taught him to count and breathe and
sing his favorite songs over and over to calm himself, to keep his brain still
and remain pointed on a single destination. It was how he made it to the
other side when walking the high wire, and if it worked in that capacity it
should work in every other, he assumed.

157

Lillya remained quiet for weeks. She believed if she wanted
something badly enough, it would come to her. The only person she spoke to
was her father and then only at breakfast and the rest of the day she
whispered commands to her horse, determined to stay pointed. In the
meantime, Anton focused on his long-term goal of proposing and marrying
the most extraordinary girl he had ever met, Lillya. Yes, she was it for him!
Word began to spread. The secret Lillya had been perfecting was
about to surface. Her timing seemed to be just right. She had stayed away
long enough to be missed but not so long that she was forgotten.
This was the time of year when all girls of a certain class were waiting
to be introduced to their future suitors and soon to be husbands and there
was no one poised to make a bigger splash than Lillya.
Petra, Anton’s mother, grew more respectful of Lillya and more
curious as well. “This is one smart girl. I wonder what she is up to myself.
I’m not certain if I did you a favor by introducing you, but I believe you will
never be bored. She seems as if she could fit in anywhere. She will keep you
on your toes, of that, I am sure. The girl knows what she wants. She’s no
ordinary girl,” she told Anton. “So, you can’t treat her like the others.”

158

Petra encouraged Anton to invite Lillya to something she knew Lillya
could not refuse, even if she wanted to. Something Petra could see was
brewing in Lillya’s soul and she decided to take full advantage.
Carl Magnus Hinne´ who had created quite a fortune and was known
to be rather extravagant had built a circus arena in St. Petersburg. Dmitri had
been looking for another gifted rider and had hired someone on a
recommendation from one of his cousins. At the last minute the man’s wife
decided she couldn’t leave her family and now the circus was left with a
cancelled starring act that would attract top dollar and no one to fill it, but
Petra saw things differently.
“Dear Lillya, my family invites you to join us in the circus riding rink
to display your skill for the world to see,” signed Anton.
Lillya’s father Yuri had been waiting and hoping that Lillya would
share her letter with them, and this time she was too excited to keep it all to
herself, and she did. “They’ve invited me into the circus.”  Lillya said as she
came running towards them.
“With your permission.” Lillya remembered that following her heart
would take her where she was meant to be, but to get there she also had to
defer to her father and ask for his permission.

159

Yuri knew he had no choice, he could see it was his daughter’s
destiny, and though anxious, he was actually thrilled that his daughter had an
opportunity to pursue a dream.
***
St. Petersburg, March 1887
All of the aristocrats left the comfort of their palaces, wanting to get a
glimpse of this daring young rider who had somehow been schooled in an art
they were all dying to learn. The men didn’t know what to do because no
respectable man would ask a woman about anything important, especially
about horses and riding. Of course, they had always considered themselves
best, but there was no denying this girl was special and she had something
they wanted. So, the men begged their wives in private to pursue lessons
from Lillya in riding. They wanted their wives to get close to her, for Lillya
was becoming a sensation. When Empress Maria invited her over to sip
lemonade and play cards with her, it was the beginning of Lillya’s own
coronation.
Just as Lillya, at the Cadre Noir, intently watched Laurent practice his
lessons, so did the aristocratic men of St. Petersburg watch their wives. The
women had gotten more attention from their husbands then they could have
imagined. They had the biggest smiles on their faces their aristocratic friends

160

had ever seen. If this young woman could get a crowd so excited by this, can
you imagine what will happen when her secret gets loose.
It had all been done discreetly so the men could save face, but Yuri
could see how differently aristocratic St. Petersburg reacted to his daughter.
Even though they had been previously well-regarded, they were now part of
an inner circle that before this they could never have dreamt to be in.
In the beginning, Anton believed he would not have a chance to be the
one to court Lillya. He didn’t believe that luck would be on his side this time
around, but he was smitten and wasn’t going to give up. Petra could read
Lillya’s interest in circus life, and encouraged her son to stay steady, as
steady as he was walking the wire. “She’ll come around, Anton, just give her
time. It’s you she wants to be with. There’s no one else.”
Before long, it seemed like everyone was chattering about Lillya and
Anton. Slowly the other interested boys let go of their hold as it became
clearer and clearer that despite their wealth and aristocratic good looks,
Anton held the key to Lillya’s passion.
The aristocratic ladies wanted to see Lillya and learn what they could,
while keeping their husbands happy and proud, because by now the
husbands had learned the art from their wives and the circus was no longer
below their status. Even the Tsarina had given her nod of approval. So, the

161

aristocrats followed her to the circus, and they stayed for the entire show.
Anton and his family, who were already famous, became more famous,
while Lillya became an international sensation, and when he got down on
one knee and proposed, the whole world was waiting to receive them, and in
the present moment they felt like shooting stars.
But as her luck grew, bitterness in another began to take hold, for all
that he had dreamed, and thought would come true had gone to someone
else. His heart and his soul would never be the same. And as his bitterness
grew and festered, it could not be moved or changed.

Chapter 29
Kungur, September 1918
Lillya remained secretive about her father’s journal. It was clear that
the stories it had to tell were written down for her and for her alone. Things
at the carriage house got a little more comfortable and routine. The teapot’s
whistle had been heard and its steam was given a way out. Gretta, Lillya and
Helena took walks most every day and actually discovered some joy and
laughter in their getting to know one another. Helena was the most
thoughtful of the three. She naturally thought of others first, but she was
very watchful over what was hers and what she felt she deserved. They
didn’t broach the subject of Natasha very often. She was the off-limits part
of their discussions and conversations. Actually, surprisingly enough to
Lillya, Gretta ended up being the most curious, maybe because she had
given up the most to stay married to her husband.
Every once in a while, Gretta would walk into a room that would fall
silent upon her entering and she was rather certain that they were doing this
not to hurt her, but to protect her. Then Helena would come over with a big
pot of tea and some cardamom cookies and hope that her offering would
bring about peace. Nikolai gave his prayers to his parishioners on a daily
basis and though the climate in the country had gotten worse, no one seemed

163

to ask very much. Michael went on oblivious to anyone’s feelings but his
own. Lillya tried unsuccessfully to turn Sophie, the workhorse she and
Anton had brought with them into a “circus” horse, missing her riding
desperately and all that she had once been. Her personal sense of identity
had become quite blurred.
Helena sometimes brought a new friend over to the house whose
name was Lana. Lana, not knowing the wall that had been built between the
other three, sometimes left them frozen. They found that Lana’s natural
innate freedom could not be shared by the others because a giant spider had
trapped them in his web and left them wrapped in the lie that had started
many years before; and it had become so twisted and ugly that like the fly
struggling to escape the spider’s trap every push and pull bound them ever
more tightly to the life they had to let go of but could not. How would they
get out of it? Lillya did not know. She approached Nikolai to encourage a
private conversation, but when she did, she discovered a layer of anger that
she previously had been unaware existed. It made her pull back, slightly
recoil and lighten their conversation. In those brief moments, Lillya had
decided Nikolai wasn’t as safe as she had taken him to be. Suddenly the
search for Natasha became that much more imperative.

164

Lana always brought laughter and fun with her, but she also came
with a certain set of restrictions put upon the three other women. Lana’s
husband, Anton reminded Lillya, didn’t wake up worried every morning that
someone could take his wife for having been born into nobility, talent,
beauty, and wealth. She was inconsequential and irrelevant to what was
going on in her country, whereas Lillya represented an existence that caused
men to fight and give up their lives.

Every once in a while, Anton needed to share a joke and laugh with
his wife, add a little levity to their situation so she would know that the man
she loved still existed. It was important to both of their well-beings for him
to see her smile and that she see him smile, too. “It’s not your fault,” he
often had to tell her. Then he would grab her hand as if they were still teens
and together, they would go down to the creek and splash and play in the
cold sparkly blue refreshing water. Their teeth chattering when they got out,
they would grab a blanket and dry each other off. Anton would smile taking
in the beauty of his wife and he would tell her over and over, “everything
will be fine. You just washed away all your troubles and the fish have
gobbled them up.”
Lillya never quit loving Anton’s attitude and spirit. He was her lifeline
to the world, her rock and savior. The trip to the creek only allowed them

165

several minutes in the water, but Lillya cherished those moments as if they
were dipped in gold. They were refreshing and helped to wash away her
sorrows and past sins. Sometimes, they jokingly referred to it as their
family’s baptismal, for Lillya would swim over to Anton and tell her deepest
secret of the day and he would gently and lovingly push her head back into
the water to wash any bad thoughts she had away and she in turn would do
the same for Anton. They wondered what Nikolai would think about them
acting as the high priest and priestess of their own lives, but it was a way for
them to feel clean not only in their bodies but in their thoughts.
Lillya and Anton worried sometimes that Nikolai might draw them
into conversations that were better left unsaid. Cutting out just about
everything that had meant something to her, her whole life before Kungur,
was harder than Lillya had expected. She didn’t know how to break free
from her identity as what she had done had been what had colored her past
and made her different. She was a flower lost in a dark forest, trying to find
the last ray of sunlight that was the key to the entrance of what she had taken
to be her life, but now this was real, this was her reality. She was no longer
the girl standing upright on her horse or the one the aristocrats sought to
teach them dressage. She wasn’t sipping lemonade on the lawn of the Winter
Palace with the empress, she was stuck in a small carriage house with the

166

same people day in and day out and she had to force herself sometimes to be
grateful. Sometimes she repainted her image of herself inside herself so she
could be someone else and find happiness and what was now the truth for
her.
Helena felt sorry for her because she could only dream of the life that
Lillya had led and even dreaming of it was more than she could imagine for
herself. But the three women stuck together, took their daily walks, laughed
at the same jokes over and over again, planted watermelon and artichokes in
the summer, and saw the seasons pass from one to another. It had become
boring, but it was a boredom they could live with and one they actually
treasured because if it was not for this, Lillya felt quite certain, she would
have joined the ranks of many of their friends.
Her mind wandered, wondering what had happened to many of the
people that had gone to that last ball that she had attended with Anton.
Where is the duchess now that so freely let the lord under her skirt or the
others dancing, laughing and gorging their bodies with food, drink, and
indiscriminate love? The Tsar and Tsarina tried their best to make the
aristocrats realize that their indulgences were only going to hurt them, but
that was more than the courtiers could see or want to see, and so they went
on with their orgies and unrestrained behavior. This civil war between the

167

Reds, the Whites and everyone else who had gotten involved in this fight
knew it was based in economics, power and wealth and the way out would
be for each of them to be less greedy in all of the above, but Lillya knew it
was impossible for any of these strong-headed men and women to come to
the same conclusion, see the truth, wear it, and dare the consequences.

168

Chapter 30
Yuri’s estate, and Vronsky Circus, March 1887
Out of respect, Lillya addressed her reply to Anton through Petra.
Dear Petra,
Please tell Anton I will come to the circus this Friday. I would be
honored to ride with you in the rink that night. Would it be possible to
schedule my performance after Anton does his, so I might watch? Thank you
for this kind invitation. I will see you Friday at 5.
Word spread quickly and the Vronsky Family circus had to open an
extra set of bleachers and two extra sections of special box seats, and they
felt rather certain that they would still have trouble fitting everyone in, as a
note had arrived saying the Tsar and Tsarina would also be attending. People
were not going to miss something as exciting as this.
The Tsarina was already thinking about lessons for herself.
Unbeknownst to Lillya, a career was being established before her first
performance and a reputation was being built that would follow her the rest
of her life.
Lillya whistled as she walked around her family’s estate. She felt a
little tight in her bones and had a sense that something bigger than what she

169

could imagine had begun. A big ball was rolling down a hill picking things
up while still gathering speed.
Lillya’s father was beside himself with excitement and couldn’t wait
for Lillya’s performance. “What will she be up to next?” he wondered.
The soft low whisper that Lillya had been keeping private while
perfecting this secret had suddenly become a roar. The courtiers at the palace
were all very interested in what Lillya would wear, the ladies in waiting and
the Tsarina drew their attention to her hands and her feet, for the empress
knew that no one would dare try to out-dress her.
Lillya couldn’t leave Yuri’s estate until the early afternoon of the
show. Word began to spread through St. Petersburg that she would perform
that night, and Lillya was obsessed with figuring out the best costume she
could wear. Once again, she preferred violet like the tulips that used to grow
in her mother’s garden. They could not fit everyone in. The best street
performers lined the entrance hoping to catch the attention of the aristocrats
who had begun to show their love of the art by hiring many of the same
performers outside the building for their parties.
The circus in Russia, given the history of the country, was still rather
new and people were working hard to demonstrate their worth and earn a
high place in the thoughts of the dukes and duchesses, lords and ladies,

170

princes, and kings. That night Anton not only did his usual act, but he added
something special, when he finished walking the wire he went to his
platform, put on a clean bright white shirt and then walked to the other side
upside down on his hands. When he got to the end, he put on a tuxedo jacket
that was neatly pressed and waiting for him and finally took his bow. Then,
with a flourish, he introduced his mother and Lillya.
The crowd roared for them both as they circled the ring doing
acrobatic tricks. And although Lillya was capable of doing all the same
tricks as Petra, she did not want to overshadow her in the show. She leapt to
the ground and applauded Petra as she circled the rink standing upright on
her horse’s back. When Petra dismounted, she took Lillya’s hand and
brought her to the center of the rink and applauded her, then everyone in the
building got up and bellowed their love of the two and when Anton joined
them and gave Lillya a kiss on the cheek, she did not mind.
“This is the girl I am going to marry!” she whispered to Petra, but
Petra and Lillya already knew this.
Yes, Anton had won the key to Lillya’s passion, but one person was
missing, the one friend she thought she could never live without, and it
broke Lillya’s heart in two.
***

171

St. Petersburg, April 1887
Lillya’s reputation had preceded her to the riding rink. Was she really
going to be the next sensation at the Palace, or was this just something that
would last for hours? Neither she nor the people in attendance knew the
answer. But the aristocratic women with the encouragement of their
husbands, believed that she possessed the knowledge of the secret art form
that they had been dying to learn. Now they had to figure out the best path to
her stables and her riding rink without being conspicuous. The noble
husbands would each come to Yuri and Lillya’s house as if they just
happened to have time to watch their spouses as Yuri’s daughter gave them
riding lessons.
Lillya did the usual stunts, taught the women the usual lessons of
safety; how to ride with their English saddles and sidesaddles, how to
exercise their thighs and push into the horse’s ribs as they went up and
down, trotting their way around the circle. As they improved, they would
canter and jump low cavalettes maybe a foot and a half high or so, and when
they finished cooling down in the rink, they would hold their horses’ reins
and bring them to the spot where the most important minutes of the lesson
took place.

172

It was at the very end that she taught them the lessons of the horse
ballet. She had two stallions that had become particularly schooled and were
more likely to behave while Lillya worked, teaching the art of dressage. She
would begin showing them how to develop the horse’s engagement, their
ability to work in degrees of self-carriage and collection – to respond fluidly
to the rider’s instruction delivered through the movements of their own
bodies. She followed on to suppleness and straightness.
Are you sitting straight? In order for your horse to be straight, you
must be straight… Practice your transitions 50 times a day… Feel how your
horse responds…
The men were very discerning, and the women, it was the most fun
that they had had with their husbands since courtship. Just as the men
desired their wives, they desired learning this art equally as much and the
women didn’t care that their husbands were using them, for they got what
they wanted. Their home was happier, and they were using less laudanum to
calm themselves down.
Lillya and Anton rose to the heights of society and the Vronsky
Family Circus soared and profited. The Tsar and Tsarina invited them to
dine and lavished upon the circus two lions to complement the two tigers
they had already sent. One was named Biscuit, the other Trudy; names they

173

had heard Americans calling one another. They all found it rather odd but
accepted it without question because the lions would draw in a larger
audience, and they came with a good story. They both knew that good
stories are never lost on an open ear.

174

Chapter 31
Kungur, October 1918
Lillya said not a word about Natasha to either Gretta or Michael, but
after a time she became clear as to the type of man her cousin truly was and
who her father became as a result. A long-held bitterness festered in her 48-
year-old body as she thought back to the missing element of her childhood.
She had not needed to be raised as an only child when her own blood cousin
lived in her home but was rendered invisible to avoid shame. Lillya began to
hate herself for being the spoiled child she had been and for treating Natasha
as the handmaid that she was but shouldn’t have been.
She tried to go inside both her father and Michael’s heads at the time,
and then she remembered that she had to include her mother, for she was
culpable, too. But when she thought of her mother, she knew her mother was
the voice of compassion, and what they had done had saved Natasha being
put in an uncomfortable position for life. This way no matter how difficult it
was on Lillya; it enabled Natasha to be free.
Then one afternoon Gretta came to the carriage house to sew with
Lillya and later they decided to take a walk. Before Gretta’s arrival Lillya
had been reading snippets of her father’s journal and had not quite come out
of that world when Gretta came knocking on her door.

175

For a little while, they laid down the pants and shirts that both
Michael and Anton needed mended. Both pretended to have normal
conversation but there was something that had come between them that
neither had been able to speak about. After several hours of sewing, they
prepared themselves for the outside, each more silent than normal.
Breathing the fresh air, Lillya opened her eyes wider, more awake and
aware of her feelings. Gretta stared back at her with a look of longing, as if
she had eaten her words and wanted to spit them out. Finally, she did.
“You know?” she said looking at Lillya as if she believed Lillya
would be aware of what she meant when she said this, and Lillya did.
“Yes, I do,” Lillya said solemnly.
“And you have not told Michael this. Am I correct?”
“Yes, I have kept this to myself. I would say something, but I believe
you know most of the story. I am sorry you have suffered so; it would bring
anyone pain. It’s hard to imagine your forgiveness, but for me Natasha
became the person besides my mother and father and Anton whom I loved
most and counted on more than anyone else. She was my best friend, so my
thoughts are mixed. Still, I want you to know I have sympathy for you
though I don’t believe that is what you look for. I can’t tell you how I know
this, but it has recently been brought to my attention and I assure you I was

176

shocked, but in a way, I wasn’t. There has always been an unusually close
bond between myself and Natasha and now I think I understand why. I think
she might be in Perm, and I would like to try to find her, but I know that
would open more wounds for everyone. So, I’m uncertain whether to be
selfish or to leave things as they are.”
Gretta responded, “We are grown now, you are a grandmother and
Anton is a grandfather, but Michael and I are not and I’m not sure if the pain
has lessened or if it will be worse.”
“For now, I will keep it to myself,” answered Lillya, and they
continued their walk in the woods in silence listening to the animals and
birds, talking to one another, trying to measure how they truly felt about the
situation but unable to share their thoughts for the wound had just opened
and was too new to know how they could live with it again.
For weeks after, Lillya felt like a train that had come to a halt and
rusted over. She could barely move and when she did, she felt like an old
piece of equipment that had lost its meaning and ability to do what it was
brought on this earth to do.
Nikolai recognized the rift that had appeared in the carriage house,
even though they continued playing cards and games in the evenings and
told each other stories that made them laugh. There was this unanswered

177

question lingering before them, and at some point, they were going to have
to answer it. Gretta kept more to herself. This was a painful subject for her,
for the man that she loved and had planned to marry as a girl had already
fathered a child with someone else. Even though, supposedly, no one knew
that this had taken place, she knew, and she had carried this secret with her
for decades. It had finally broken loose, and it was no longer hers alone to
carry. Helena continued to try to be the peacemaker amongst the six of them,
always with a smile, always trying to make the best of their situation.
The three couples continued to keep each other occupied but a sense
of uncertainty seemed to linger in the air. No one seemed to be quite sure as
to where they stood. Helena wanted to keep everyone happy. She laughed
even at the smallest joke and always tried to bring something good to the
table whether it be food or attitude. Anton just took it as the anxious feeling
people get after being cooped up in a small space staring at the same walls
having the exact same conversation night after night, not wanting to face the
fact that they had come to a state of boredom brought on by their
untruthfulness with one another. It was as if everything was stuck. But how
could they break loose. Finally, Lillya opened her mouth and just blurted
out, “I’m going to look for Natasha.” Michael’s face turned white with
shock, Gretta’s face turned red in anger and betrayal, Anton knew he would

178

stay by Lillya’s side no matter what she did. Nikolai gave a look of
seriousness knowing that Lillya’s venture could lead to trouble for all, and
Helena just stood there with a quizzical look, utterly confused not
understanding what was happening. The secret that had been lingering and
carried on the backs of family, loved ones and friends had gotten too heavy
and there was now no turning back.
“When did you find out and how?” asked Michael. Silence struck the
carriage house like a bolt of lightning.
Anton stood up surprised, wondering, why is my wife talking like this.
Lillya looked at Anton with a face full of guilt.
“I’m sorry she said, but I made a promise, one that I can no longer
keep.”
“I don’t understand,” Anton said again.
“If you will be patient with me and just listen, the truth will be
revealed,” Lillya implored.
“Perhaps I should be the one who tells this story as I am the one that
caused it,” Michael intervened.
“If you don’t mind, I’m going to leave,” said Gretta. And she silently
walked out the door, no goodbyes. She just put on her coat and left.

179

Lillya knew she had opened a vault that had been closed for years and
in order to examine the contents, like the objects in a musty old box, the
cobwebs would have to be blown away before anyone could see what was
really there.
Helena turned to Nikolai hoping for some look of recognition, that he
would have a clue as to what had just occurred, but he looked as unknowing
as she. Lillya could see she was looking for an answer and broke in.
“To my knowledge,” she said, “he knows nothing.”
Michael broke in and began to speak. Lillya could tell by the look on
his face that each breath he took caused more anguish and the pain just
permeated his body and got deeper and deeper and went to the past, through
all that had transited and what had been done and how he hadn’t seen his
daughter since she was a young girl and how she had never known him as
father. Then he looked at Lillya almost pleading for forgiveness. “I’m
sorry,” he begged, “we did what we thought best” and he sat down on the
chair next to him and didn't say another word until Anton spoke.
“I hate to say this my darling,” Anton said to Lillya, “but in this
political climate it is better that no one know, especially Natasha.”
Lillya in her heart had known this, but being so close to Natasha,
being in Perm made it so difficult to accept. She so badly wanted her near

180

and to have one last opportunity to love her like a sister, or a cousin, and
declare her as hers.
The truth was out. There was no more to say for now.
Michael looked at Nikolai and Helena. “I must be a big
disappointment to you. We can all be guilty, but it is up to each of us to do
what we can to correct our mistakes. It is not a time to be selfish, rather it is
time to put one’s best foot forward and learn to become the person you’ve
always hoped to become.”
And with that Michael walked out the door to try and find Gretta.

181

Chapter 32
St. Petersburg, September 1887

On the night of Anton and Lillya’s wedding, people danced in the
streets. What she wore was kept a secret. Many were told she wore her
riding clothes and special leather pants that the Empress Maria had made for
her that gave her more traction on the horse. They were married at the
Trinity Cathedral and the service was attended by a wide variety of people
from the world of the nobility and the circus including her 19-year old
childhood playmate Nicki, the Tsarevich, who would become Nicholas II
when his father, Alexander III passed away, but no one expected that to
happen for decades.

Lillya’s father Yuri was a Baron and that made Lillya a Baroness. As
his only child, she was the sole heir to the family estate, farmlands and
mines in the Urals.
Anton’s family was also of the nobility. His great grandfather was a
Count and the family had land and horses on the plains near Moscow.
Dmitri’s Grandfather was a champion horseman who really did run away
with a small circus when he was young and his father, rather than dragging
the boy back home, bought the circus and paid it to entertain him and the
family. A few generations later the circus was known all across Russia and

182

each of the children gravitated to their respective passions. Dmitri was
drawn to the high wire as was his son, Anton. His Aunt Olga flew on the
trapeze and his Uncle Peter was a master clown.
Lillya and Anton unwrapped their many wedding presents, one more
grand than the other. In some ways, it embarrassed Lillya to be surrounded
by such grandeur, but the nobles didn’t stop. They rewarded Lillya with
horses and pieces of art from around the world and many fine bottles of wine
and vodka that came from the Tsar himself, some of which she insisted on
sharing with her father.
The following year, Lillya became pregnant with her first child,
Vladimir, who was born in October 1888. He was a chubby baby born
weighing more than ten pounds. Lillya was grateful for the strength in her
legs and torso that had come from riding. As a toddler, he was slow to walk
and loved crawling and hiding all over the house. When he did begin to
walk, he would always fall down but then laugh it off without any crying or
fear of pain or injury. The one time he did cry was when he walked under a
table and bumped his head on it so hard that he got a lump that stayed with
him for weeks.
At around four Vladimir began asking for a baby brother or sister.
Lillya and Anton explained that they were asking God for one but there was

183

a long wait for boys and girls who could be in the circus. For now, he could
play and go to school with the other children of circus families. This
satisfied him but he would bring it up occasionally.
***
St. Petersburg, March 1890
One evening Lillya and Anton attended the new Tchaikovsky ballet
Sleeping Beauty. They were joined in Dmitri and Petra’s box at the
Mariinsky Theater by Anton’s friend, Pelé Petrovsky, a self-made
millionaire who ran a textile spinnery named Petrovsky & Sutton. He was a
tall, gentle, bear-like but dapper young chap in his early thirties. Like Anton,
he had a keen interest in horse racing and raced about a dozen of his own
horses.
To their surprise they saw the most exquisite young ballerina named
Katya Sidorovskaya, the understudy for Carlotta Brianza in the role of
Princess Aurora. Despite their initial disappointment at not seeing Brianza,
all members of the audience were enchanted by this newcomer. Pelé was
particularly entranced by her and asked Anton if he could introduce him to
this heavenly creature. Of course, Anton was always welcome backstage at
the ballet, so he took Pelé and Lillya down into the cellars of the theater and
to the dressing rooms where the dancers where relaxing and changing. When

184

they arrived, they found Katya listening intently to the Ballet Master, Marius
Petipa, an old friend of the family. Petipa greeted Anton warmly and
introduced him to Katya, his new protégé, but Katya laughed – she had
known Anton since the summer she performed in the circus pantomime and
giggled endearingly about being paraded around the ring in a cart pulled by
four dogs. Pelé was euphoric and soon Katya was joining them all for
supper.
Katya was from Veliky Novgorod on the shores of Lake Ilman. Her
father was a baker and her mother a dance teacher. She was the first Veliky
Novgorod child to attend the Imperial Theatrical School. Her father beamed
with delight at the news but especially her mother who had taught Katya
how to move gracefully from the time of her first steps. Entire train cars of
town residents came to St. Petersburg of the day she first appeared in the
Corps de Ballet at the Mariinksy Theater, and they cheered raucously when
she took her bow.
Pelé was the son of a carriage maker from nearby Luga. He was
initially quite awkward in her company. Though only 17, she charmed him
with her curiosity abut his education and business. Her effervescence
dazzled him, her humble, practical upbringing reassured him that she would
not become a diva. Nonetheless, their courtship had to thread its way

185

between the demands of the ballet and the spinnery. He was ready to get
married within weeks, but she had prepared too long to step away from the
ballet just at the moment of her breakthrough.
The next September she danced in the role of Nikiya in a revival of
The Temple Maiden, choreographed by its creator, Petipa himself. The
reviews were wonderful, and Pelé had the good sense to celebrate her
success with her while being patient about his romantic interest. Besides, he
had a business to run and then he had to spend time with her mother and
father and seven siblings all of whom came to visit during the week of her
debut as a prima ballerina. Katya’s mother loved him and was in awe of his
beautiful townhouse and a spinnery that bore his own name – an amazing
accomplishment for a man barely more than 30 and even more so, he was
one that could admire his beloved as she basked in the glare of the spotlight.
The following spring, Pelé and Katya got married at the church of
Saint Simon and Anna in an event attended by royalty of circus, dance, and
commerce and as well as an appearance of actual royalty in the person of
Tsarevitch Nicholas, who attended the reception and offered a toast for the
newlyweds at the invitation of Lillya and Anton – left Pelé agape. Who were
these people, Pelé thought, who could bring along the future Tsar of Russia
to his own wedding.

186

After a honeymoon in London with a side trip to Pelé’s old haunts in
Manchester, Katya returned to the ballet for another season. She danced in
that year with a power and grace she had not discovered before her marriage.
Those days were short, however, as she became pregnant toward the end of
their first year. Of course, she had to stop dancing, but she was quite joyful
about the prospect of her first child. She vowed to return to the ballet but
most of her peers doubted she would be back. Indeed, she was having the
best possible life, and most would have traded places with her.
When Katya got pregnant Lillya shared time with her every day to
monitor the changes in her body. Because Lillya had just been pregnant with
Vladimir, who was still nursing, she was particularly appreciative of having
the opportunity to act like a sister and mother figure to Katya. The baby was
born on their estate attended by the best physicians and midwives in the city
as had been the case with Lillya and Vladimir just three years earlier.
Katya gave birth to a beautiful girl that they named Donatalia. She
seemed at first to be a delicate child but soon proved to be sturdy and even
precocious. She walked early, sang and danced incessantly and adored her
mother.
They hired a middle-aged woman named Madame Elena Strachkov to
be Donatalia’s nanny and to teach her French and piano. Madame Strachkov

187

was referred to them by Lillya who knew her family. She was unmarried,
had grown up in St. Petersburg and been an accomplished teacher at a music
conservatory before she suffered a riding accident and lost her left leg below
the knee. The injury made it harder for her to get around and she sought a
live-in nanny situation, and Pelé had more than enough rooms in his
mansion. She soon became a family fixture and Katya depended upon her
for everything having to do with Donatalia.
Her mother didn’t want to push Donatalia into dance but as soon as
her bare feet touched a hardwood floor, they sprang to life like a newborn
fawn’s in a meadow. She seemed sometimes to dance with fairies when she
was alone and had acute senses of sight, sound, smell, taste and touch and it
made one wonder what else. Generally, she was a quiet child and always
seemed to have patience when it was needed.

188

Chapter 33
Carriage House, Kungur, November 1918
Then one night it happened. Anton and Nikolai were tending some of
the parishioners; helping them with their chores, the ones that were too
difficult for them to do themselves. Michael had stayed home that night,
feeling too tired to do any more work, while Gretta and Helena had gone
into the main house to check on yet another pie along with a stew filled with
potatoes and leeks that they would eat later. Lillya thought that Anton and
Nikolai had finished early and then she heard the footsteps of horses
approaching. She was a little bit concerned because usually the two of them
made more noise and would be talking and laughing yet this time she only
heard the footsteps. The steps leading to the front door of the carriage house
began to squeak and still there was no sound of talking and laughter.
Lillya froze and opened her mouth, but she was unable to get a sound
out. She began to shake right at that moment. Three tall healthy young
soldiers that clearly wore the colors of the Reds abruptly entered through the
front door which had been left open. One of them looked like Arkady, a
friend of Lana’s and she didn’t understand his intentions. Then he grabbed
Lillya by the throat and covered her mouth with a rag. The youngest of the
three men threw Lillya into a chair but then decided that questions were

189

better asked in private because clearly, she was waiting for someone to join
her and it would be much easier to get the information they wanted to get
from her if she were by herself rather than them having to fend off who
knows what, how many, or how old. The only question that they asked was
“How well do you ride? Can you still get that old body of yours on top of a
horse or do we have to carry you or pull you in a trug?”
Lillya looked at them and realized she had no choice but to go along
with what they said for if she screamed, she knew her Anton and Nikolai
would come running to save her as would Gretta and Helena and maybe
some unknowing parishioners. She knew she couldn’t do this to the others.
For Anton it would be certain death, so she kept her mouth sewed tight and
only did what they asked or said. Still, she had a pretty good idea as to
where she would ultimately land, but she didn’t know what they would do in
the meantime and how they would treat her along the way.
They took her horse but left the others that they found in the carriage
house below. They knew that whoever the horses belonged to, they would
come after them once they realized that Lillya was missing, but the horses
that Lillya and Anton had been using were old workhorses that could not
stand up to the stallions the soldiers were riding. As a matter of fact, they
had Lillya ride on the back of one of their horses and eventually let the

190

workhorse run free on its own because it was only going to slow them down
and put their own lives in danger. Lillya said not a word, for she knew why
they had come and what they wanted. She was to be an example of those
who did not stand with the people even if they did not stand with the Whites
as well.
When Anton reached the house soon thereafter, Lillya heard the echo
of his yells and could feel the pain in his heart. Her heart broke in two as she
not only loved this man but had adored him for all these years and she didn’t
know what to do except to not draw attention to him and bring him closer to
an ill fate because if the soldiers got to him it would most likely be the end
of a love that had been nurtured for years and Lillya couldn’t bear the
thought of having done that to him.
***
Road to Petrograd, a few days later
They took her hands and tied them behind her and let her know in no
uncertain way that she would be dead if she tried to get away. Though at
first, she tried to fight, and bit one of the officers. Somehow, they had found
out who she was and the family she came from – that her mother had been
an aristocrat and her father the wealthy owner of a large estate and although
her husband had owned the circus and they had all appreciated it when they

191

were young, they had to take a stand now and let them know what the
challenge was. She wondered if Lana or one of the others had informed on
her, but she knew she would never find out.
The next morning, Lillya woke up in a railroad freight car, her hands
and feet in shackles and a soldier making tea for her and another prisoner.
Funny thing, they made a tea out of bergamot. Lillya wanted to bring to their
attention that bergamot was the tea of the Tsar and if they were fighting
everything he represented, they should not like this tea. She kept asking
what their decision was, and what they were going to do with her. She didn’t
ask about Anton because, if she was lucky, they didn’t know about him.
Lillya could easily guess where she would be going. The closer they
got, the more familiar the smells became. Even though the country was in
the middle of a revolution, the water and the flowers still smelled the same.
The familiar scent Lillya had grown up with and known since birth.
The men who captured her were tough, strong, and sturdy and let her
know that they meant to do what they were doing. She represented her class;
the class these men were determined to blow apart. She was frightened, but
she kept her fear in place, for being afraid was not going to do any good for
anyone. She knew that Anton had to be frantic; even if he was about to be
sent to the front lines, he would be more afraid for Lillya than for himself.

192

She wished she knew where he was and what they might have planned, if
anything, after all Anton was still a circus man.

Chapter 34
St. Petersburg, November 1894

Tsar Alexander III died unexpectedly of kidney disease. His son
Nicholas II would take over leadership of the vast Russian empire when he
was only 26. The young man’s fiancé, Alexandra of Hesse and Rhine was a
German. But this was not unusual, even Catherine the Great was a German
royal bride when she first came to Russia and Alexander had already given it
his blessing.

Since Nicholas and Lillya had been childhood playmates she could
address him as Nicki. He had attended Anton and Lillya’s wedding a few
years earlier and so they were in turn invited to his wedding. It was decided
that he should marry Alexandra  known to them as Alix, soon after
Alexander III’s death in a relatively small ceremony in a chapel of the
Winter Palace which took place on his mother’s birthday because it was
considered a joyful day and a wedding on that day would not be considered
inappropriate during the period of mourning for the tsar.

For a wedding present Anton and Lillya gave Nicholas and Alexandra
two beautiful golden Palominos – a colt and a filly that Anton had acquired
from America through his circus connections. These were quite rare in
Russia and the newlyweds both delighted in seeing them romp and chase

194

one another in their fields looking pale as ghosts among their bay, chestnut
and black Orlov-Rostopchin Trotters and Arabians.

Their first child, the Grand Duchess Olga was born the following year
and Lillya and Anton attended the christening. At the time, Vladimir was
just turning six and would sometimes accompany his parents and the new
royal parents and children on outings.
***
Moscow, May 1896

On her first trip to Moscow, Donatalia marveled at the marvelous
onion domes of St. Basil’s Cathedral with their bold colors and unusual
shapes, like delicious sugary decorations on a dessert or Christmas tree.
What a stark contrast to the birthday cake shaped rectangular buildings of St.
Petersburg in their monotonous pastel pink, green, yellow and blue. Peter the
Great used only bricks and mortar to build his new city whereas Ivan the
Great, or the Terrible if you prefer, was especially fond of onion domes and
made them the signature of his capital.
Yuri, Anton and Lillya attended the coronation of Nicholas II at
Dormition Cathedral inside the white brick Kremlin Fortress walls.
Following the ceremony there was a large ceremonial procession which
included the spectacular Life-Cossacks Regiment walking six abreast.

195

In the evening Nicholas invited Empress Alexandra to throw the
switch on an enormous electrical illumination of the Ivan the Great Bell
Tower and the massive Kremlin walls. The gathered thousands were dazzled
by a display of electric lights that brought the brightness of midday to the
evening sky, outlining the silhouette of the magnificent fortress in
shimmering white light. Bursts of gold and red crossed the faces of the
ancient majestic structures, and then all of it could be seen again reflecting
off the Moskva River. It was more startling and transformative than any
magic trick or religious ceremony. The throng of Russian humanity that saw
this firsthand felt it was entering a new world, one that would resemble the
kingdom of heaven.

A few had seen photos of the illumination of the Chicago World’s
Fair and there were some electric lights in St. Petersburg, but no one in
Russia had ever been witness to something as overwhelmingly beautiful as
this
Two days later, the Masked Ball was held at the Kremlin Palace, the
first of many balls to take place that week. Anton attended dressed as an
Ottoman Sultan with Lillya as his harem girl and Vladimir as his servant.
Pelé came as a great Russian Bear; Katya was a svelte lady bear and

196

Donatalia a fluffy white cub with a scarlet bow. After enjoying the ball, the
families returned to St. Petersburg, exhausted but thoroughly enchanted.
***
Madame Strachkov and her family stayed another day to attend a
public celebration thrown by Archduke Sergei, then the governor of
Moscow, at Khodynka Field, the very same place Nicholas’ father
Alexander III had used just 13 years earlier in the celebration of his own
coronation. Offering free beer, food and a souvenir enamel cup containing
gingerbread and a sausage. Perhaps because of the improved transportation
system, the event drew a much larger crowd than anticipated – over a
hundred thousand eager guests arrived by six in the morning and were to be
watched over by only 1800 police.
For Madame Strachkov the scene had initially been exciting and
celebratory but when rumors spread that there was not enough food and
souvenirs for all. She waited behind as her cousins Fyodor and Anatoly
began walking toward the tables where the gifts were to be given out.
But then all she could see was a panic taking place amidst the crowd
and much screaming and shouting. The only one who returned was Fyodor.
He tearfully told his family that they couldn’t see anything in front of them
except for the people’s backs and then suddenly everything opened up ahead

197

of them. They saw tents, those from the which the gifts were to be given.
They rejoiced but only for a moment. The way was open in front of them
because they had come to a ravine and all who were in front of them were
falling into it, then they felt a push from behind and then they were falling,
too, falling onto people and then people were falling onto them, and they
began to panic. They crawled up to their feet but under them they could only
feel something soft – people!
Fyodor lost sight of Anatoly as people grabbed onto his arms and legs,
and it took all his strength to shake off one then another and tread upon the
struggling mass of people. When he got to the other side of the ravine, he
turned to look for Anatoly, but he was nowhere to be seen. Fyodor screamed
out his brother’s name, but no one answered. He spent hours at the ravine,
looking for him, hoping to rescue him, pulling out one person then another
hoping against hope that Anatoly would be alive at the bottom of the pile but
it was not to be. When Fyodor finally found him, his body was limp and
silent and could not be revived. Crushed, suffocated, it didn’t matter. He was
gone.
They had no means of transporting his body home and had to leave
him there to be buried in a common grave. The family gathered round him to

198

pray before his body was taken away for burial. Their return trip to St.
Petersburg was filled with grieving rather than joy.
Nicholas heard about the tragedy and came to the site later that
afternoon only to find it empty as the police had collected all the fallen
bodies and sent the crowds away. His staff kept the worst details from him,
and he was not fully apprised of the severity of the disaster. To his eternal
regret, he attended a ball that evening at the French embassy and appeared to
some onlookers to be indifferent to the cruel deaths of his subjects. This
earned him the nickname “Nicholas the Bloody” – a moniker that would
prove to be bitterly prescient.

Chapter 35
Nearing Petrograd, December 1918
As the freight train carrying her and hundreds of soldiers and horses
neared the city, Lillya recognized the smell of Petrograd air, a mix of river,
sea and the smoke of coal from factories and ships. She knew all along that
the soldiers would eventually take her there. She was a symbol and nothing
more, and she knew it. The men who were guarding her knew she had
nothing more to offer the Bolsheviks than representing a trophy aristocrat.
The journey from Kungur had been more emotionally than physically
exhausting as each step she took she knew would take her further away from
Anton. Of this, she was very sad. She had been preparing herself for several
years, so what was happening now was not such a big surprise. She knew the
day would come and it would be more than a goodbye with her father or
their old way of life. She agreed with the Reds on many levels for she could
see the greediness of her own class and couldn’t understand how they were
unable to see that they were creating their own destruction.
She listened to the boys’ conversations with one another. For that’s
what they were, simply boys. Boys who wanted to feel they had made their
mark, made a difference in the way their people, the Russian workers and
peasants, could live their lives. She wondered how their taking her was

200

going to make any difference to the world that these young soldiers wanted
to create for their people, but right or wrong, she knew they had to do it, just
to seek or believe they had sought justice for their own class, which had
been punished by the nobles and they wanted the nobles to know that they
had taken enough. Lenin, Stalin, Trotsky and all the others had set out to
seek power for their fathers, brothers, mothers, friends and neighbors but the
greed of their own hearts, she felt, was going to be their downfall just like
the rest. She savored the air as it began to smell like her father’s estate. She
knew they couldn’t be far from the center of the city and recognized that she
would soon be in the company of many familiar people because the only
place they could be taking her right now was Peter and Paul Prison.
“Pray for the martyrs of the revolution,” she heard people saying and
it got louder and louder the closer they got. Rumors of the Peter and Paul
Fortress had spread across the country. It was the place where they took
those that did not carry their beliefs, where many prisoners from the upper
classes were jailed and humiliated to cut them down a notch or two.
Ironically, it was located directly across from the Winter Palace where Lillya
had once been celebrated and admired. In a strange way that fact gave her
strength that she never expected, reminding her who she once was and still
was inside. Listening to the soldier announcing their arrival, she had to

201

steady herself to take the next steps without showing the fear that she felt
inside. She wasn’t as calm as she tried to appear to be.
Click clock, click clock – she could hear the sounds of soldiers
approaching. For a second the sound of the horses reminded her of all the
wonderful equestrians she had met along the way in the circus and before.
She even felt a little piece of Herve Laurent fly by her, and she wondered
where he might be in the world and was he still the terrific horseman he had
been.
It was easy right now to let her mind wander to circus days and
wished she was able to have contact with her son Vladimir. She wondered
how their circus was doing. Circus had grown up and the American circuses
like the Ringling Brothers and Barnum and Bailey Circus had really made a
splash. Their own circus had been more about skill and athleticism than
showing off large, tamed lions and tigers. In this moment, she had a sense of
what those animals must have felt being held inside their cages, unable to
run or escape or find a way out. In an indescribable way she felt as if she
were doing penance for all the harm their animals had been through, not so
much with their circus because Anton and his family had had very strict
rules as to how the animals were to be handled, but suddenly she felt bad
about the many homes they must have broken up, and she didn’t understand

202

why she had never seen this before. She had always felt she was in a higher
place in the animal kingdom and if she treated the animals with respect, she
wasn’t doing anything wrong. However, in a few moments she would be like
all the rest. Her freedom was about to disappear. She did not know if she
would ever see her family again or even the stars at night. She would have
no one to rely on. She had never really been alone. Here she was an old lady,
a grandmother she thought, and she had never had to fend for herself. She
had always been given everything. Now she was like everyone else; she
would be given the exact amount of food that the other prisoners were
allotted and soon she believed she would be scrubbing toilets like the rest of
them dressed in the same dirty garments, eating the same uncooked hard
potato and hoping a scrap of bread would be left that she could use to barter.
Anton had sheltered Lillya from the streets and the people who
roamed them. He didn’t think or know that she had learned a lot about street
life by just watching him. For the time being she would be unable to make
her own choices, used as a symbol of what society couldn’t accept, and
really neither could she, but they were raised to believe that they were born
with a place already designed where they would belong and be expected to
follow undefined rules. It was a matter of luck as to how one would spend
their life, what they could do and what they could become. She had no

203

choice but to be anything other than who she had been raised to be. She kept
thinking of Anton. He had been born to be in the circus, not tied up in this
mess with her. Nikolai and Helena she presumed would be alright and
Michael would have bought himself and Gretta a way out. She was the one
that they wanted, the one that would make a statement and if Michael could
give them money, well, for now that would be enough.
When they arrived at the fortress grounds and took her from the cart,
they blindfolded her. This was meant to incite fear in those that were
brought to the prison and to satisfy the soldiers who sought justice for all
that they had lost and given up.
This was the beginning of a new life for her. Her old life was scattered
somewhere in the dirt that she was walking on, but her spirit was alive even
though she didn’t know where it belonged or where it would end up.

204

Chapter 36
St. Petersburg, September 1896
Lillya had taken a bad fall and the unborn child that she had been
unaware of but that nonetheless was growing in her belly died. The doctor
told Anton, “Thank goodness she gave you a boy before all this trouble.”
Anton didn’t know what to say or think. He loved his son, but he also
knew he would have equally loved a little girl, especially if she were as
pretty and sweet and talented as his Lillya. Anton was just happy he didn’t
have to make these decisions or uphold these ancient ridiculous rules of
inheritance.
***
Cadre Noir, Saumur, France, October 1896
Lillya’s notoriety had spread and though she could not imagine it
crossing a continent, it did. Little did she know it had made its way to the
Cadre Noir and into the ears of her once admirer who by now was so boiled
over in anger he would have been unrecognizable to her. He had nothing but
smiles and happy thoughts when she had known him as a girl, now he spit
fire with most every word especially when news reached him that she had
borne a little boy named Vladimir.

205

He thought about the gypsy woman in the woods that day long ago
remembering how his body had been drenched in sweat and he had become
delirious. “Did I let her make a curse or was it just a dream?” he often
wondered, but then how could he explain the serpents skin resting next to
him when he opened his eyes? That day had become such a blur in his mind
that he had become unsure, so he washed it out of his thoughts as much as he
could.
Still, whenever he came upon travelers who had been in St. Petersburg
he wasn’t able to stop himself from asking if they had gone to the famed
Vronsky Family Circus and had they seen the famous equestrian Lillya
perform her act and when they said yes for a  minute or two he imagined her
as he had seen her that first day in the woods in the Loire Valley galloping
standing upright on her horse’s back and he would be taken once again by
her beauty and talent. Then reality would strike him again and he would start
spitting out words of how Lillya wasn’t as good as she or the people thought.
She, like that circus, was only an illusion. Then he would stomp off leaving
whoever he had been talking to completely baffled and confused.

As Lillya and Anton’s child grew older Lillya’s first and only French
boyfriend began hearing rumors of her boy, Vladimir. He followed in his
father’s footsteps and became expert at walking the high wire. He was also

206

given the prestigious opportunity of attending the Imperial Theatrical
School, one of the most famous schools of its kind in the world. All
opportunities, Laurent felt, that should have been bestowed upon his son, the
one he didn’t have. But she would get what was due her, he always thought.
And when a rumor came to him in the form of a secret note tucked under a
silver tea pot with biscuits and flowers surrounding it and upon reading it, he
thought justice had been served.

207

Chapter 37

Peter and Paul Prison, December 1918
When they opened the door to the cell block, the stench almost made
her pass out. She could hear drops dripping from drains of one sort or
another, but she didn’t know where they were coming from.
She could feel the dampness in the cavernous stone walls that
surrounded her when the jailer opened the door to a holding cell. Still
blindfolded, she put her hands up and let the palms touch the stone. She
wanted a better sense of her surroundings. She heard men and women
mumbling, but she couldn’t see who they were.
Stripped down by a female prison guard, she was put into a threadbare
uniform and marched through long winding passageways. The little bit of
food she had in her stomach started to rise to her mouth and she found
herself bent over, letting out every ounce of bad meat, bread and pig’s feet
she had eaten along the way.
Men and women were calling out to her from behind iron gates and
thick stone walls trying to figure out who the new prisoner could be. The
guards encouraged other guards and prisoners to reach out and touch Lillya,
but not hurt her. They had to be able to show her off first!

208

Fear rose in her body just as they wanted it to. She felt like a volcano
about to erupt. Their goal was to intimidate her, and they did. Lillya wanted
to cry but she refused to give them that satisfaction. She was going to have
to be strong and it began here.
How can I be so close to home and have it all be so different? This is
not the St. Petersburg I have known and loved. These are not the same
people I have known and loved all my life.
Finally, they stopped at the end of a long hallway. The jailers talked
amongst themselves for several minutes, then opened a small door, removed
her shackles and blindfold and pushed her into a cell that was as dark as the
blindfold when her eyes were covered.
She called out, “Is anybody home?” to show she had not lost her sense
of humor entirely. Many voices answered back with questions and advice,
but she didn’t want to speak any more. All the prisoners together made one
sound, the bittersweet note that would ring in her ears for many days and
weeks and months to come.
She didn’t want to give the soldiers the feeling that just by catching
her, finding her, they had won the war between them. She stood very
proudly with a sincere look upon her face to prove she was not afraid even if
that wasn’t the truth. She was determined that she would make the best of a

209

horrible situation and find a way out, but she had no idea with whom or how
it would take place.
The cell door was slammed and locked behind her and all the little
noises she heard along the way seemed to echo and get louder and build to a
cacophony; an orchestra of delusion and pain because everyone had their
own idea as to who was to blame and what would be taken away and what
would remain.
The next morning, she was served a small bowl of something - she
didn’t know what it was or what it could be. She didn’t want to think about
it; it certainly didn’t come close by any means to Helena’s cooking in
Kungur or the biscuits Gretta would make her or the fish her husband would
catch for her. Every once in a while, someone would yell out to let everyone
else know they were still alive. Lillya had never been alone before. She had
always had her father, Natasha and later of course Anton, and she felt very
alone.
What did they plan to do with me? Lillya wondered. Her imagination
was too vast, and she really didn’t want to think of all the misfortunes they
could have planned for her. Cleaning toilets, she could handle. It would be a
joy, considering what else they may have had in mind. So, she spent her
days locked up in a cell with ten minutes of exercise in dark, bitter cold.

210

She felt like a child once again, hiding in the stables of her father’s
estate in the dark, unable to see the invisible creatures that would frighten
her later, as she tried to sleep, knowing that she could not
In the past, she had a house full of people whose job was to care for
her. The strange man in the cell next to her was whispering and humming
and to Lillya’s ears sounded sorely out of tune. She wondered how long she
was going to have to listen to this and she soon found out – all day.

211

Chapter 38
St. Petersburg, December 1896

One winter afternoon when their son and daughter made a snowman
together, Pelé talked enthusiastically with Anton about asbestos and his
factory’s newly installed asbestos spinning and weaving equipment. This
enabled him to produce thousands of yards of fire-resistant fabrics for
theatrical curtains and fire fighting gear.
Anton was genuinely fascinated and asked Pelé for a tour of his plant.
Pelé obliged and Anton was so impressed that he returned the favor by
introducing him to Grand Duke Sergei who conceived of many uses of this
cloth by the Imperial Russian navy. Heretofore, they got all their asbestos
material from the Italians at a much higher price. Pelé was amazed by
Anton’s easy interactions with the royal family and extremely grateful for
the introductions.
***
St. Petersburg, January 1897

On New Years Eve in the Orthodox calendar Pelé, Katya and
Donatalia rode a sleigh pulled by their Orlov Trotter Chayka over the Neva
to Lillya and Anton’s townhouse. They ate a light supper of bilinis, caviar,

212

pickled herring, sliced radishes, pheasant, rabbit and all manner of desserts
and they toasted the young Tsar at midnight with the finest champagne.
Lillya noticed the sweet interaction between the nine-year-old
Vladimir and Donatalia who was just six and obviously adored him. Katya
made a comment about the ice sculptures they’d seen from their sleigh and
Anton regaled his guests with the story of the ice castle made by Empress
Ann in 1740 to taunt her son Prince Michael for marrying an Italian
Catholic.
“Good thing attitudes had changed,” Lillya stated, her eyes flashing.
“Your own mother is a Catholic Italian, isn’t she?”
Anton’s mother Petra had been a star of the Venice circus and he
would grow up speaking Russian spattered with Italian superlatives.

The story ended with Prince Michael and his mock bride, a Kalmyk
hunchback no less, being forced to spend a night on a bed made of ice in a
massive ice castle which made everyone shiver, especially Donatalia.
Vladimir charmingly came to her aid with a story about his favorite clowns.
Later in the evening the adults played card games while Vladimir and
Donatalia looked at a book of pictures of the circus including a watercolor of
Lillya atop a magnificent horse named Pluto Gaetana who had been given to
her by Alexander III.

213

Lillya invited Katya to follow her into her dressing rooms to try on a
few gowns and look at some jewelry for an upcoming occasion. Of course,
Pelé showered Katya with many beautiful things, but a young woman her
age, a premiere dancer no less, never has a large enough wardrobe to wear
something new to so many different occasions. Katya was a village girl and
Lillya took great pleasure in treating her as though she was her niece or
daughter. They often went shopping together and Lillya helped her pick out
the best couture and jewelry to be had in St. Petersburg. They even made
shopping trips to Moscow. They often exchanged gifts and on this particular
evening Katya was looking through cases and cases of Lillya’s jewelry and
came across an emerald brooch that she thought would look very good with
a gown her dressmaker had recently made for her. Gowns from a dressmaker
were such a novelty to a girl whose only dresses had been handed down to
her from a sister or two. She grinned with delight when she turned to show
the brooch to Lillya but when she did Lillya nearly gasped. She knew this
brooch lay among her other jewels, but she never wore it or took it out. She
hesitated. What should she do with this? She didn’t want to keep it. Her
father had said that it was just a worthless bauble, and she shouldn’t bother
sending it back, that that would only lead to more communication with him,
poor Laurent, who neither wanted to engage. Best to give it away or throw it

214

away and keep the story to herself. She felt sorry for Laurent, but now she
had to forget about him completely.
“Yes, of course. Take it, you can have it,” she found herself saying.
Katya screamed with delight and hugged Lillya. What harm could it do, she
thought.

215

Chapter 39
Peter and Paul Prison, December 1918
Lillya, following Anton’s lead, tallied the days she had been in the
prison on the wooden leg of her narrow cot. And she had dreams. She
wondered if her horse was still in the pasture, whether their gardener or
caretaker or her father’s companion had stayed on, would he have been able
to? She wondered who was still living and who was dead. Most of all, she
hoped there were others in hiding like herself, or had they been unable to
give up their obsession with always being noticed because this time it would
not have a pleasant ending. How many people were living on their estate and
who were they? All these thoughts filled her days.
In the far-left cell from where she was placed, an old gypsy woman
was singing a song about love and pain. As sorrowful as her voice could
become, she continued on. Lillya found herself secretly admiring her
because she told the truth and shared her feelings. Gypsies were not very
well-received most anywhere, but in this case, the Reds had jailed and
punished them the same way they had their aristocrats.
Lillya was later to find out the woman’s name was Rosa. Rosa was
curious about Lillya, for she appeared different from the many other
aristocrats Rosa had come in contact with. Even in this darkened state, Lillya

216

had more of a feeling for life than the others, who just took their
imprisonment as defeat. Rosa kept to herself when the prisoners would walk
in sets of ten at different times in the middle of the prison.
Lillya thought about Peter the Great, and wondered how he would feel
about his fortress being used in such a way. She steered her mind away from
things that she couldn’t control, but instead focused on seeking relationships
that she might develop and use to find a way out of there.
Lillya did everything she could to keep from vomiting up what little
was left in her stomach. Not even a thin mattress could be found, and the
officers spat on her. She didn’t think her cell could get any darker, but then
night came. The solitude was the worst of all. Lillya knew she was alone;
she just didn’t know how many years, months, days, hours, that would be
true for her.
Then she heard a dark, deep voice, “I can see you’ve never been here
before.” Afraid to be silent, but more afraid to talk, she curled her body on
the bare wooden cot, hoping not to make any noise, thinking that if she was
very quiet, he would think she was no longer awake. She knew her thoughts
were not rational, but she didn’t want to believe her situation and the man on
the other side of the wall continued, “I heard you were coming. You have no
worries. We may not eat so well, and the boys can be a little rough, but they

217

don’t put you in the same category as some of the others. You’re lucky your
husband owns a circus. Who does not have happy thoughts of visiting it as a
child? I myself ran away once, wanting to join the circus.”
Lillya shivered in her corner and did not say a word. He could be a
plant for all she knew, and then where would that lead her? “Don’t be afraid
of me,” the man continued. “You have to trust someone within these walls.”
Lillya tried to shut out the voice. She didn’t want to hear what he had to say.
It was too much for her to take all in one breath. A shiver went up her spine.
Cupping her hands over her ears, she tried to cut out the noise of both
the drops from the pipes and the stranger who seemed to be in the cell next
to hers. She was afraid, but she didn’t want to admit it. She had to be strong
now, but this time for herself alone. She could think of no one else at the
moment – her friends and family in Kungur would all have to be doing the
same, if they were lucky enough to still be alive.
She started to imagine, in the dark, herself riding her father’s stallion,
the wind in her hair once more, reminding her how strong she had always
been and how brave she was now in this present moment. Being in prison
was certainly an obstacle and not a pleasant experience, but she had things
yet to accomplish, people she needed to see – Natasha still being the main
one.

218

But now she was mostly curious as to what her own routine would
become and how she would live day-to-day – what they would feed her and
how bad they would treat her.
The strange man in the cell next to her continued whistling horrible
songs, humming out tunes and just didn’t stop. If the Reds wanted to torture
someone, Lillya was certain they had found the way. But these men believed
that her station at birth gave them the right to punish her. It didn’t matter
who she was, what she was like, or what she had done - just being born into
the upper class made her fair game. For days, she was just getting acclimated
to the present. The past made her too sad to think about, and the future
seemed impossible. Every once in a while, Lillya thought she recognized a
familiar face - someone whom she may even have seen in the ball at the
Winter Palace. That seemed lifetimes past but was only about two years ago.

219

Chapter 40
St. Petersburg, June 1897
Pelé Petrovsky loved large, pulsating machines and powerful engines.
His passion rivaled that of Lillya for her beloved horses and Katya for the
ballet. He was the son of a carriage maker from a village halfway to Moscow
who demonstrated a remarkable talent for tinkering in his early childhood.
He was famous for fixing any machine that could be handed to him and by
the age of 20 he was acknowledged to be the finest mechanical engineer St.
Petersburg University had produced in decades.
His fascination with fabrics and textile machinery had taken him to
Manchester, England also known as Cottonopolis where he learned about the
latest cotton spinning machines from the men that built them. While there he
perfected his English and made the acquaintance of Archie Sutton and many
other future colleagues, customers and investors.
Pelé was making elaborate plans to expand his business, the Petrovsky
& Sutton Spinnery, into the premiere textile manufacturer in Russia – it
already rivaled the best in Moscow. He’d invited his English business
partner Archie Sutton and his wife Winifred to dinner that evening, and they
would be bringing along with them an American cotton grower from
Savannah, Georgia named George Bradley and his wife Mary.

220

Brady’s land produced some of America’s finest Sea Island cotton – a
rare long staple cotton with a silky and radiant white fiber. If he could secure
a long-term deal for Bradley’s cotton, he would gain a great advantage in the
European market where fabrics made from this cotton sold for a very high
premium. And, to top it all off, there was even evidence of large deposits of
chrysotile or white asbestos on his properties in the mountains of
northwestern South Carolina.
The potential profits made Pelé and Archie’s mouths water and eyes
bulge. They hoped that giving George and Mary the royal treatment and a
large advance would seal the contract. The Bradley’s were spending the
summer in St. Petersburg and Katya had already had Mary and their young
daughter Rosie over to tea and card games. Donatalia got along well with
Rosie, and they enjoyed playing in the garden. Mary made an impression on
Donatalia as an especially kind and generous person.
It was six o’clock and Pelé paced impatiently expecting his wife to
return in time to greet their expected guests. Only a few hours earlier, he had
bickered with her about staying home to prepare for their guests, but she
dismissed his concerns, saying the staff was quite capable of setting the table
and preparing the dinner, after all she had spent the day before shopping for
flowers and pastries. They had everything they needed and now she planned

221

to join Lillya and a couple of old friends from the circus for an afternoon of
tea and card games at Yuri’s townhouse.
The effervescent giggling gaggle of ladies had just finished their game
of Preferens when Katya complained of a “tummy ache” and politely asked
to leave before the serving of even more tea and delicate pastries. As
Katya’s carriage driver brought round their barouche she was trembling, pale
and feverish. Lillya suggested a remedy and offered to call her own doctor,
but Katya dismissed all that as unnecessary.
When his doorbell rang, Pelé assumed it would be their guests, and he
sighed in exasperation. Mme Strachkov answered the door, but instead of the
Sutton’s and Bradley’s she was met by two police officers. She could see
Katya’s driver Alexi behind them shaking and looking guilty. Pelé was
called to the door but immediately grew furious, certain the driver had been
involved in some kind of traffic mishap but before he could grill Alexi one
of the officers politely informed him that his wife Katya had died of a burst
appendix. Alexi had urgently driven her to Mariinsky Hospital, but she
passed away in the emergency room. There was nothing that could have
been done. The officers asked Pelé to come to the hospital to identify her
body and make arrangements with an undertaker. He was stunned and
couldn’t believe it was true until Alexi broke down crying in front of them

222

because he hadn’t been able to get through traffic and believed he himself
was responsible for Katya’s death. Pelé and the police did their best to
console him but then Pelé himself broke into tears at the sight of Katya’s
coat and scarf.
Donatalia’s piano teacher, Madame Strachkov, was asked to explain
what happened to their guests when they arrived. Pelé hurriedly told the
bewildered Donatalia that her mother’s appendix had burst to which she
could only respond, “What is an appendix?”
The following day Lillya called to find out if Katya was alright and
Pelé told her the bad news. Lillya came over immediately to offer her
sympathy and support to Pelé and Donatalia. Lillya took a special interest in
Donatalia because now they both knew the pain of having their mother’s die
when they were just children.
***
St. Petersburg, September 1897

A few months later, the Bradley’s and Sutton’s came again for dinner
and to close the deal that would bring the Bradley’s fine Sea Island cotton
exclusively to the Petrovsky & Sutton Spinnery. Even now, Pelé boasted,
their Egyptian cotton was made into the finest shirts, sheets and dresses in
St. Petersburg and astute buyers looked for the Petrovsky & Sutton label. At

223

the same time, Archie Sutton cautioned his bear-like partner Petrovsky about
the risks of having underpaid and dissatisfied workers, imploring him to
make concessions to avoid strikes and disputes. Pelé, however, dismissed
these concerns saying that Archie didn’t understand Russian business. If he
raised wages all the other factory owners would savage him because their
workers would strike and they would be forced to raise their wages and then
the whole system would collapse. “Trust me,” he said. He understood the
Russian working class and he knew how to handle the troublemakers that
were threatening to disrupt production.

224

Chapter 41
Peter and Paul Prison, June 1919
When she first got to the prison, she imitated Anton’s method from
their journey to Kungur by making marks on her prison cot so she might
know what date it was and how long something had actually taken her, but
after a while she forgot to make the mark or wondered if she had made it
twice and she lost track of the days and finally just gave up caring about the
date altogether and only recognized the seasons and the moon changing in
the sky. What did one day mean over another? She found it useless, and that
frightened her because she didn’t care.
Sometimes prisoners would put out a stick to see if they could trip
someone just for their own entertainment. Lillya felt it cruel and
unnecessary. She didn’t expect to be having fun in prison; she expected to
find a way out but had no clue as to how to make that happen. Then one
afternoon in the prison yard near the end of her time allowed outside, she
noticed a woman staring at her, one of the guards. She couldn’t figure out
what the woman wanted, but eventually she was motioned to come forward.
She did, the woman yelled at her, and Lillya got upset, “Why did she call me
over if she was just going to yell at me?” But as she was leaving, she noticed
an apple in her pocket; something that she hadn’t had before. She couldn’t

225

even imagine what an apple tasted like because it had been so long since she
had had a piece of fruit - something fresh, something juicy, something sweet.
She couldn’t wait to get back to her prison cell although she didn’t know
how she would eat it and not be noticed. She was afraid of getting caught,
but could not turn down this gift, and slowly over the day and night she
nibbled it. The next morning, the same guard who had yelled at her the day
before happened to be assigned to keeping Lillya in line out in the prison
yard. When Lillya left to go back to her cell she found half a pear in her
pocket, this was the most exciting event that had occurred to her since she
got to the prison - someone was being kind to her, or was it kindness?
The exercise ground had a couple of trees and Lillya had thirty
minutes of fresh air a day. She was able to wash once a week and always left
with a chill that lasted through the night. She was served hot water and black
bread and was grateful. Lillya prayed every night but as time passed, she
became uncertain for whom she prayed and whether it was for death or life.
The man in the cell next to her continued having one-way
conversations with her, but she remained steadfast in not answering,
believing it could only lead to trouble. He continued talking, for he had no
one else to hear him, and he had much to say about what was going on in
their country. He used to carve little pieces of driftwood that one of the

226

soldiers would bring to him and for a short period of time each day, he was
even trusted with a knife to make the faces and the legs and arms out of
these little pieces of wood, and he gave them to the soldier to take home for
his children to play with, and they developed a friendly relationship. Lillya
listened to what the man would say to the soldier, and after some time,
realized that perhaps the man had a motive to his mission.
At night, the prisoners sang out different melodies with their own
words to get simple messages to the others. It could be as simple as taking a
hymn they sang in church, one that everyone knew, and a man or woman
wailing out their names and telling the others they were still alive. Just
before dawn, the guards couldn’t help but get a little sleepy themselves and
things that would never get by them during the day went unnoticed in the
night.
A woman guard, sent to clean Lillya once a week, slowly developed a
familiarity with her. She entered the cell with a bucket of clean water, soap
and a stiff brush to scrub off lice and ticks. She was suprisingly patient and
gentle with Lillya; sensations Lillya had not felt since her days with a lady’s
maid. Then one day, she brought them a small cake and split it in two and,
without Lillya ever saying a word, they were bonded into a fellowship.
Soon, Lillya found her voice as well. She had gone without speaking to

227

practically anyone since she had arrived. She discovered that she had more
in common with this woman in the prison than she could have imagined.
Their biggest bonding taking place over horses and riding. Her name was
Julietta, and they developed an actual friendship, and to her great surprise,
one afternoon Julietta met her at the prison gate, Lillya believing she would
be going on her typical morning walk, but instead there was Julietta’s horse,
bridled and saddled. Julietta took the reins and handed them to Lillya. Many
others in the prison looked on in disbelief, but for those ten minutes, Lillya
flew through the yard with Julietta right behind and the smile on Lillya’s
face was almost bigger than the horse itself. She didn’t know that she could
be happy again and thought that it would have been impossible, but here was
proof that it wasn’t.
When Julietta had Lillya all to herself, she stopped and took Lillya
aside and handed her a note that could be kept only between the two of
them.
It turned out that Julietta’s father had once run the popcorn and candy
concession stand at Dmitri and Petra’s circus. So, unbeknownst to Lillya,
Julietta had known Lillya all of her life and she remembered the good deeds
Lillya’s family had done for hers and for her person by letting Julietta keep
some of the costumes that had been made for circus acts – bright colors: red,

228

purple, fuchsia, gold, like the colors of some of the most beautiful flowers,
dahlias, and Julietta  played with these outfits and they made up much of
what her family could not offer her. Dmitri and Petra sought her father’s
opinions, and she remembered her mother telling her how the respect they
had shown her father helped him to grow and become a better man and if
their Lillya was in the prison, Julietta knew it was her duty to find a way to
get her out. This was the first time Lillya had heard such an idea from the
lips of Julietta; the first time she had reason to believe she might have a way
to find Natasha.
One night a sweet message came out of the man in the cell next to her,
“She’s my daughter,” he sang. “She’s my daughter,” he sang again, “She’s,
my daughter.” Later in the evening another verse came out, “Trust her, trust
her, she’s my daughter,” and Lillya recognized that the man had been put
into place to help her. All these months she had been cursing him.
Later that same day, Julietta came again to take Lillya for her walk out
into the courtyard and she jiggled some keys that she had in her back pocket
and whispered in Lillya’s ear, “One night, when you least expect it, your
door will be open, and it will be time for you to leave. There will be
someone waiting for you, I can’t tell you now who it will be, but my father

229

recognizes your importance and has arranged a way for you to go and not be
seen.”
Lillya shivered and started to cough. It was hard for her to take in
what the woman was saying and believe it could be true. But then, she had
nothing more important to do than to better her circumstances, which
couldn’t have been much worse. And even if these other underground
soldiers would use her for their own ploy, it was better than spending her
days and nights in the prison all alone and she would be able to see the moon
and stars and maybe find Anton, or her father, or even Natasha.
Then one night she found her cell door unlocked.

230

Chapter 42
St. Petersburg, August 1904

As the children of Nicholas and Alexandra grew old enough to ride,
Lillya became their first riding teacher. As a baroness, she was a Lady-in-
Waiting to the royal family and was familiar with the palaces and imperial
stables. Her first pupil was Grand Duchess Olga who turned five in 1900.
Olga was a fearless and determined rider, even at her early age. The Grand
Duchesses Tatiana, Maria, Anastasia each born two years apart began to ride
as children under the guidance of Lillya in the Tsar’s stables and horse
training grounds at the Winter Palace in central St. Petersburg and the
Alexander Palace in Tsarkoye Selo.

Alexei Nikolaevich the Tsarevich was born in August of 1904 and
Lillya shared in the royal family’s joy at the birth of the heir to the empire,
she even had the honor of being allowed to hold the infant one day when the
empress brought him out to greet his sisters.
Even as a toddler, Alexei was delicate but nonetheless very curious
and eager to try anything new. He loved to be placed on a horse with Lillya
or his mother. He was often required to appear in public on horseback and in
military uniform, so his training extended to walking and parading but he
was not encouraged to gallop or jump for fear of an accident.

231

***
St. Petersburg, October 1904
At 16, Vladimir was already handsome and charming. He had a
swagger, a kind of presence when he walked, a composure. People seemed
to focus on him just as he focused on the steps he took crossing the wire to
the other side. He was magnetic. All the girls at the Imperial Theatrical
School were drawn to Vladimir and they all fell hard for him.
One special girl, whom Lillya would have adored him to choose was
her dear friend Katya’s daughter, Donatalia, a very talented ballerina who
also attended the Imperial Theatrical School, and as her mother had been,
she too was at the top of her class and would one day be a prima ballerina.
However, she was three years younger than Lillya’s Vladimir.
Liking the girl, while at the same time feeling a sense of kinship with
her, as they both had experienced terrible losses at a young age, Lillya would
go out of her way so that Donatalia would feel less alone and know that she
had another woman she could talk to besides her father’s partner’s wife,
Mary Bradley of Savannah, who had been especially kind to Donatalia that
first summer.
Lillya would invite Donatalia to do things mothers and daughters
would enjoy doing together; after all, Lillya had borne a son, but she still

232

liked sharing many girlish things with someone who appreciated her
sensibility and friendship.
She could tell by the way Donatalia fidgeted with her hands whenever
Vladimir entered the room or spoke to her that the girl had a crush on her
son. And she could tell by looking at Vladimir and the way he responded to
Donatalia that it was probably true for him as well, but three years was a big
difference at that age. Vladimir was getting ready to graduate and Donatalia
hadn’t even struck her middle stride. Donatalia was reaching up to the stars,
wondering when she’d catch one, while Vladimir was already shining like
one. But it didn’t stop Lillya from enjoying the friendship her son and
Donatalia kept, thinking that their crush was unknown to others, when to her
it was perfectly clear.
Then Lillya remembered that day in the coffee shop when Donatalia’s
mother told Lillya about the conversation she had with her daughter in this
exact same spot about the tea for the Tsar and all about Bergamot, and the
dangerous path the men would travel through China just to please the Tsar
and Tsarina. She had heightened her nose and its ability to remember a scent
and how special was its flavor and that of the delicate cardamom seed when
it fell out of its shell. Like the stories Lillya would later tell. The aroma of

233

her tales was always potent and undeniable. They were the kinds of stories
people liked to pass on.
***
The Winter Palace, December 1904
Tsar Nicholas II and his wife Alexandra requested that Lillya’s son
Vladimir and Donatalia, create a special performance for them and present it
on the lawn of the Winter Palace. It would be a private spectacle. Everyone
would know about it, which would create a buzz of excitement, but few
would be invited to see it. It put Vladimir in an enviable position among his
peers and Donatalia, well, just the sight of her became unbearable to many.
Girls had spent years waiting for a chance to be chosen to become the
“prima” dancer at the school just like Donatalia had waited, too, and she
shared with Lillya her dreams that one day she would represent
her country, Russia, like Anna Pavlova or Agrippina Vaganova.
Glittering chandeliers hanging from the painted ceiling dimmed ever
so slightly as the spotlight was turned to Grand Duke Sergei Alexandrovich,
the Tsar’s uncle. When he started playing the melody to Kalinka, the
empress’ favorite song, on his famed flute everybody began to politely roar
and clap their hands.

234

Anton contributed several courtly clowns and two fire-eaters and to
make the evening even more of a family affair Grand Duke Sergei joined the
circus band playing a lively melody as their tigers Midnight and Satin
jumped through hoops. Despite all this, Lillya felt as nervous as she had
before her own first performance at the Winter Palace many years earlier.
Then Tsar Nicholas signaled the sign of silence with his hands. Not a
sound could be heard other than the sound of their breathing. The musicians
played their first gentle notes and her awkwardly tall, adolescent son
approached the utterly still Donatalia to take her hand.
At the first spark of Vladimir’s fingers touching hers, Donatalia began
to thaw her frozen form. Handsome Vladimir was there to rescue her and
lead the way. Like a magician surprising a crowd by pulling a rabbit from an
empty hat, she took her first step. Astonished by the perfect fluidity of her
movement, Vladimir was entranced. With each step she slowly drifted into
what he referred to as the otherworld, for she was gifted in ways he had
never witnessed before.
When the Empress Alexandra soaked them in her smile and nodded
with approval, Lillya knew at once that she had been blessed.
Donatalia and Vladimir moved like butterflies, free in their motion,
like a young Roman god and goddess, telling their story.

235

***
Later that evening, Lillya and Anton introduce Donatalia’s father,
Pelé to the Tsar and Tsarina. He could barely keep himself from trembling
with awe at meeting the man all Russians regarded as a deity, their divinely
chosen king. The most venerated man in the country and now he was
standing before him making small talk about his daughter’s dancing ability!
Pelé had done his fair share of hobnobbing with the royals. His friend
Anton had introduced him to Archduke Sergei when they came to the see the
horseless carriage company in which Pelé was an investor and racing
enthusiast. Sergei had a great interest in the newest technologies, and it
wasn’t long before Pelé was telling him all about carriages and engines and
when Anton dropped the fact that he was the Petrovsky of the Petrovsky &
Sutton Spinnery he was fully enthralled. In no time they were talking about
cotton and to Sergei’s amazement, asbestos! Asbestos for fireproofing was
essential for ships, especially naval vessels and this would lead to big
Imperial Navy contracts. Pelé would repay Anton for the introduction with
an asbestos curtain, a circus tent and a hundred colorful circus costumes of
the finest silks and cottons.
When the Russian Imperial Baltic Fleet prepared to sail for the Sea of
Japan, Pelé took Donatalia on a tour of the battleship Oslyaba before it left

236

port. He wanted her to see all the fine uniforms and asbestos fire fighting
suits that were made with fabric from his spinnery. The ship was enormous
and Donatalia loved climbing up and down the many stairways to the upper
and lower decks and admired the crisp white uniforms of the hundreds of
officers and seamen.
Donatalia loved her father’s enthusiasm for his business and
understood how much pride he took in showing her his products. When he
demonstrated his spinning and weaving machines or made her feel the
textures of the fabrics that came from his looms she felt as though he was
dancing his own ballet but only for her.

237

Chapter 43
Outside the walls of Peter and Paul Prison, Petrograd, June 1922
Lillya was met by a group of people dressed in dark clothes,
apparently one in uniform but not dangerous to them. She was rushed away
to a small rowboat. Silently, they took her to a shack on the side of the river
opposite the Winter Palace. There a few people spoke gently and politely to
her. They gave her food and water which she devoured feverishly. Later they
brought her some Vodka but were careful not to give her too much. She
recognized some of the voices from her circus days, but she was no longer
able to put names to the faces.
These people were the survivors of her family’s circus! They had
rescued her and intended to hide her in the midst of the new circus they had
created after the revolution and civil war. The circus was popular again in
Lenin’s Russia.
She was kept hidden by young men and women who had seen her and
Anton and even Vladimir perform when they were children. They knew they
could learn much from her but for the time being they would have to keep
her presence among them a secret. They would keep her near their horses
and let her teach them the skills she still knew and could perform well, but
not in public, at least not by her real name. She begged to perform in a mask

238

and the director almost let her but decided against it for her own good – even
masked, her perfectly balanced slender frame would give her identity away.
For her part, Lillya was happy to work in stables to get regular meals,
a bath now and then and a warm place to sleep. She didn’t even trouble
anyone to find out what they knew about Anton and her father. There would
be time for that, and besides, she feared the worst and was not eager to hear
it spoken.
The Bolsheviks loved circus. Lenin promoted the resurgence of
popular independent circus troupes and many of the performers from Anton
and Lillya’s circus were working again and basking in the adoration of
proletarian audiences just as they had the aristocracy.
***
Leningrad, May 1924
One day when Lillya was out shopping on the Nevsky Prospekt, she
ran into Helena, Lana and Gretta gazing into a shop window. She was
surprised to see them and approached them eagerly but when they
recognized her, they reacted as though they were seeing a ghost and
frantically ran away, perhaps they believed they had seen a ghost. Did they
believe she was dead? Did they know the fate of Anton? She stood frozen

239

and baffled watching them run. She could only hope that she would see them
someday again and learn from them.
***
Leningrad, 1926
Lillya worked with a small circus under a secret identity. She trained
the youngest riders and occasionally even put on a secret show for her
colleagues – still able to astonish them. Unfortunately, her talent gave away
her identity to a few who remembered her distinctive style.
A few months after the death of Lenin, which was a sad occasion for
everyone in the city, she spoke laughingly of the new leader, Joseph Stalin
saying that he is a man of small stature who surrounds himself with even
smaller men to make himself feel bigger than he really is.
Lillya was ratted out to the State Political Directorate for this
defamatory statement by a rival circus horsewoman who was jealous of her
talent and legend. One morning officers of the secret police known as the
GPU appeared at the stable while she was cleaning out the stalls and took
her away.
She was identified as Lillya Englehardt, the baroness who escaped
from Peter and Paul prison and sentenced to 20 years of hard labor in the
work camp on Solovetsky Island in the White Sea.

240

She was put on a crowded train to the camp with a number of St.
Petersburg’s most talented actors, musicians, writers, and artists. Seldom had
she kept the company of such a distinguished group of citizens. Many
recognized her and acknowledged her talent, and all commiserated on the
truth that their talents and achievements were now of little value – indeed for
many they are the very cause of their persecution.

241

Chapter 44
St. Petersburg, January 1905

On a wintry St. Petersburg Sunday in January, the much-loved Father
Gregory Gapon lead laborers demonstrating for better working conditions to
protest in front of the Winter Palace. The Tsar was not at the palace and
could not go out to meet them, as they had hoped.
Lillya, Anton and Yuri were staying at their townhouse near the
palace. In the afternoon, they heard hundreds of gun shots and there was
panic in the streets beneath their windows. The crowd had grown unruly and
Imperial Guards and Cossacks began firing at them randomly. The chaos in
the capital was rising to greater and greater heights but the Tsar still refused
to make any concessions to the desperate people.
This event was a catalyst for the formation of organized resistance to
the government. Factory workers, professionals and peasants began forming
councils called Soviets that allowed them to collectively air their grievances
and elect delegates to higher levels of the pyramid.
At Petrovsky & Sutton a group of the most vocal and belligerent
workers had formed a soviet lead by a certain Konstantin Orlovsky, a lean,
bitter uneducated man whom Pelé regarded with disdain because after
reading a few pages of Karl Marx he thought he knew how his business

242

ought to be run. He reported to the newly formed St. Petersburg soviet. Pelé
spoke to the assembled workers about the advantages of working together
and making sacrifices for the company so it could grow and expand but they
demanded higher pay for shorter hours and all manner of governance and
management concessions. They wanted to run the company now and they
were more than willing to strike to get control of it.
***
Nikolsky Gate, Moscow, February 17, 1905

A nitroglycerin bomb wrapped in a newspaper was tossed into the
carriage of Grand Duke Sergei Alexandrovich blowing him to bits, the same
Sergei who only a few months earlier had played the flute for Lillya and her
family at the Winter Palace. He was the uncle of the Tsar, a beloved family
friend, frequent guest at the estate and a confidante of both Yuri and his
father.

Lillya, Anton and Vladimir attended the funeral of Sergei at the
Chudov Monastery inside the Kremlin in Moscow. As they entered the
chapel this moment gripped her with sadness and dread just as the funeral of
Alexander II had affected her as a girl of eleven. She gave her childhood
friend Nicki a hug and saw the fear and uncertainty in his eyes. Sergei had
been a special adviser and confidante of the young Tsar even though he had

243

been blamed for the disaster at the Khodynka Field on the day of his
coronation.
The Archduke’s body had been so mutilated by the blast that his
coffin remained closed, and his beloved Preobrazhensky Life-Guards
Regiment uniform was draped over the remains, as he had wished to be
buried in this uniform.
Pelé and Donatalia took the train to Moscow to pay their respects to
the Archduke and the royal family. They could not be permitted into the
family events that Anton, Lillya and Vladimir attended but as the Royal
family exited the monastery Nicholas II spotted them in the crowd and
nodded sweetly to them, Donatalia gasped and turned to Pelé asking him if
he had seen what she had and he agreed tearfully that he had.
Since the reviled Bloody Sunday in January the royal family no longer
came to the Winter Palace and retreated to the Alexander Palace at Tsarkoye
Selo. Lillya would take the train out to the Tsar’s village and continue giving
riding lessons to the royal children under the watchful eye of the Imperial
Guards.
***
St. Petersburg, May 1905

244

Russia was at war with Japan over control of ports on the Pacific.
Nicholas II sent the pride of the Russian Navy, the Baltic fleet, from St.
Petersburg around Africa and through the Indian Ocean to the Pacific. Like a
drunken gambler, the Tsar went all in and lost everything on a single roll of
the dice when the Japanese sank seven Russian battleships in the Battle of
Tsushima killing 5,000 Russian sailors. Among the ships that went down
was the Oslyaba, the very one Donatalia had visited with her father just a
few months earlier. When news came out about the disaster, all she could
think of was the crew of young sailors they had met a few months earlier
that were now lost at sea.

The Russian public reaction was stunned into a feeling of emptiness.
The Tsar and the government barely acknowledged the defeat. That
morning, Russia was the world’s third greatest sea power but by nightfall its
formidable navy was gone. There would be no triumphant return of the fleet
or victory celebrations and little if any public mourning. Yuri and Lillya read
about it first in the French and German press.
A few months later Russia and Japan would sign a peace treaty in
Portsmouth, New Hampshire brokered by US President, Theodore
Roosevelt. Russia was humiliated, while Japan was fatally emboldened.

Chapter 45
Solovetsky Island, 1926
After arriving at the labor camp Lillya is first put to work in the
kitchen but seeing her interest in the horses, she is reassigned to caring for
the animals and working in the camp gardens. The worst things about the
camp are the constant humiliation, penetrating winter wind and hunger. The
best things are the camaraderie of her fellow inmates and the opportunity to
be out in the open air. The camp has about 35 Don River horses, the horses
of the Cossacks and the favorite war horse of the Russian Army. They were
extremely strong animals and could go for weeks with very little food and
water. Thousands of them and their Cossack riders had been brutally
slaughtered in the last war due in no small part to the use of machine guns,
mines, barbed wire and rapid-fire artillery. These new weapons made the
horse worse than useless in war. They were now only big unshielded targets
after thousands of years of being the most fearsome things on any battlefield.
A captain from the cavalry stopped in to see her one day. She could
not imagine why. But it turned out he had heard the rumors about his
prisoner, Lillya, and how she could make magic on a horse’s back. He
wasn’t very friendly or kind, as a matter of fact, he stuck a pistol to her head
and demanded she follow him out to the barn where all the horses were kept.

246

He told her to pick a horse; that they were both going to ride. Lillya became
extremely fearful and asked him where they would be going. He didn’t
answer her but kept on walking forward. Lillya sensed that she was in
trouble and that she had only one choice and that was to do as he said if she
wanted to live. He shot a bird overhead that was flying by, just to let her
know he meant business and he had one of the boys in the barn saddle up the
horse and when he was through, he handed her the reins. “Come,” he said,
and she did. They entered a quiet part of the barn, more isolated than any
place she had seen thus far, and he said one word, “Teach.” Lillya was rather
confused. A captain in the Red Army asking her to teach him an elitist form
of horse art, but that was exactly what he was doing. His name was Paul
Blatsky. He was married to a French woman named Brissetta. He kept it
very impersonal. He was actually cold and rather mean to her, but she knew
he was drawn to her knowledge and as long as she could show him
something valuable to him, she would survive.
Captain Blatsky came when he could. He didn’t have any set
schedule, and he never told her exactly what he wanted and exactly what he
would give to have it. It was silent but understood. Lillya knew she could
not mention this to anyone, which made it more difficult for her among the
prisoners. She was too old for them to assume he wanted a physical

247

relationship, but they all wondered what did she know that would make the
captain desire to spend hours with her? For Lillya, it was the only time she
felt free. The wind when she rode felt like soap and water being sprayed
upon her body, and even though she would ride until she was in a wet sweat,
she felt clean and sometimes even hopeful. She didn’t really want to
imagine, what the other aristocratic men and women were being forced to
do, for it was too awful. If she could ride, cleaning toilets would be a joy.
She wasn’t afraid of hard work, unlike the other aristocratic ladies.
She was stronger and less frightened than most of the other women she
knew. Her years with the circus had made her bolder, and more open, less
afraid of approaching the unknown. Determined and strong-willed, she
wasn’t going to let her age and the wear and tear on her body stop her from
dreaming and finding a way to change her situation. Lillya was resilient and
she had no intention of giving up. Being where she was did nothing but
inspire her. She was going to find Anton, go to Natasha’s cave outside Perm,
and see her grown-up grandchildren and her loving son. Whatever it took,
she was going to make this happen. She was a force to be reckoned with
when she got something fixed in her mind and she had made an internal
decision to follow her dream and find the way home to her family.

248

She prayed Anton would be there, too. She had no intention of having
her epitaph say, “Lillya died in a cold, wet prison.” She was going to live,
and she was no longer bound by the rules that would make her submit.
***
Forced Labor Camp, Ust-Kut, Irkutsk Oblast, Siberia, July 1931
After Captain Blatsky was promoted, Lillya was herself promoted to
wrangler-at-large for all varieties of horses on the lands of the Soviet empire.
She was sent to a series of camps in Siberia including Ust-Kut in Irkutsk
Oblast along the Lena River in the watershed of the Lena-Angara Plateau
north of Lake Baikal. This was a land of endless valleys and rugged
mountains, riven by two great rivers, the Lena and the Angara, that flowed
north into the Arctic Ocean. The rivers froze over in winter and flooded with
fresh melt in the spring. This camp’s notable alumni included Lev Bronstein,
later to be known as Leon Trotsky. His comrade, Ioseb Jughashvili aka
Joseph Stalin served time in Novaya Uda in Ust-Undinsky District a mere
300 miles distant.
In her journey across the vast eastern plains, Lillya met for the first
time several breeds of Russian wild horses including the Przewalski’s horses
also known at takhis. In one encounter with takhis she dismounted and
walked toward a small herd of the short, big bellied, four-toned creatures.

249

Amused by their white noses, brown heads and light-brown torsos ending
with black legs, she walked among them grazing near a stream. She stood
still for an hour until one slowly came near and circled her to determine her
intentions. Their bellies and heads reminded her of the zebras in the circus
menagerie, but she had not spent any time riding them – why bother with
them when she had so many beautiful horses to ride.
The filly grew bored and walked back to the group, but a young colt
came near and nudged her with its nose. She grabbed onto his mane and
stroked his neck. Drawing him closer, she pulled herself onto his back and
whispered in his ear. He shuddered with the sudden awareness of having a
rider atop him for the first time. The camp guards watched her in disbelief as
they have never seen anyone ride one of these horses. The horse carried
Lillya to his herd, and she ran with them for a few hours. She wanted to
stand up on his back as she once did in the circus but feared that her age and
the lack of a good bone doctor in Siberia made the cost of falling too great to
risk.
Another time she saw Yakutian horses being driven by a group of
Yakut herdsmen. These short-legged horses have highly attuned noses and
ears to sense the approach of any predator. They evolved from domesticated
horses brought to the region by the Yakut indigenous people in the 13th

250

Century. They were docile and had hair as long and thick as a sheep’s wool.
In Winter, they could smell plants growing beneath the snow and dig down
with their sharp hooves until they got to them. They hibernated for months
standing upright, covered in snow looking like a field of moguls that
awakened and shook off its icy coat in the Spring.
The Yakut kept dozens of them and used them as a source of milk and
meat which was quite fatty and considered a delicacy. Despite being short
and rotund they were a wonderful riding horse in the rugged terrain of the
plateau. Lillya even got on the back of one and rode it standing up. When the
animal got tired, it stopped and would not move. They Yakut children
laughed historically as Lillya stomped on the shaggy creatures back to no
avail. She stopped short of training them for dressage, though she thought
they would look rather cute prancing and side-stepping in a horse ballet.
Everyone in the camp was released when the Germans invaded Russia
in the Summer of 1941 – not out of kindness but because the government no
longer wanted to be responsible for feeding them.
At that time, though 71 years-old, emaciated and addle-brained, Lillya
wanted to again begin her journey to Perm to find Natasha. Fifteen years in
the Eastern wilderness passed like single night’s dream. She had spent her
fifties and sixties tending to horses instead of the grandchildren she knew

251

existed but had never seen. Her dotage had been stolen from her, but it was
gone now and there was no value in bitterness and regret. She was at least
grateful that she was allowed to spend in the company of animals and
beneath the limitless Siberian sky – much better than the starvation and
bloodshed that took place in the West beneath the fist of Stalin. She walked
out of the camp with a horse and a sack of potatoes and after a few weeks
came upon a small station on a spur of the Trans-Siberian Railroad and
boarded a train back West.

252

Chapter 46
St. Petersburg, October 1905

Strikes paralyzed the city and only the St. Petersburg Soviet could
persuade the railway and factory workers to go back to work when their
demands were met. After first resisting, Nicholas capitulated and accepted
their plan for a democratically elected representative government. The
following spring, Yuri was elected to the Duma, Russia’s first experiment
with a European-style parliament.

Pelé Petrovsky had felt wary of the risk of living in Russia as early as
May and told Donatalia to be prepared to be sent to America in the fall
unless things improved. Of course, they had gotten much worse.

Donatalia objected quite vigorously. She pleaded with her father not
to be sent away, not to be forced to drop out of the Imperial Theatrical
School, not now just when she was just hitting her stride. She threw daily
fits over his demand that she leave her friends, her budding career and her
beloved St. Petersburg because of a few strikes and riots. Yes, the Archduke
had been assassinated but who would bother to harm her, just a young
ballerina who only wanted to make people admire her dancing. Nonetheless,
her father persisted and booked passage to New York for her on the
enormous new ocean liner named Amerika that sailed from Hamburg. It was

253

decided that he would accompany her to Hamburg and return to St.
Petersburg after seeing her off. Always the optimist, he told her he expected
to come to visit her in New York the following Spring and that they would
travel to Paris together. There would be many exciting opportunities for her
in New York, some of the best dancers and teachers in Russia were
emigrating to the United States and she was sure to find a thriving expatriate
community there. He’d even made arrangements for her to stay with an older
Russian woman named Catherine who was the sister of an old family friend,
but nothing would appease Donatalia.

“We’ll find a place in the neighborhood and make a happy life for
ourselves,” he said on the boat to Hamburg. “There are plenty of business
opportunities in New York.” He arranged for her to study with Olga
Preobrajenska who trained under Marius Petipa before he was forced out, for
political reasons as rumor had it. “I’m afraid the way things are going it’s
too risky for you to return to Russia until things settle down.”

The hardest thing was saying goodbye to her teachers and classmates
at the ballet school, especially Vladimir who she was madly in love with
though she could not bring herself to say that to him, especially now
knowing that she would probably never see him again.

254

Pelé bought her several new outfits for the trip and Donatalia went
through her mother’s things to find a few pieces of jewelry to remember her
by. She chose a gold bracelet, diamond earrings, a pearl necklace and an
emerald brooch that had been a gift from Lillya. She thought she could wear
it with a particularly nice new green dress.
***
St. Petersburg, November 1905

A few days after returning from Hamburg, Pelé received a telegram
from the steamship line informing him politely that Donatalia had fallen
down a stairway on board the ship and suffered a broken leg. He was
crushed. All his efforts to protect his daughter had resulted in an injury that
would surely bring an end to all her dreams of becoming a ballerina. She
was right all along; he should have kept her here with him in St. Petersburg.
What would her mother Katya have thought of him now? He wept for days
and shared this terrible news with Lillya who sympathized and encouraged
him to send Donatalia a telegram via Catherine. He was barely able to get
out a few words:
The world is big, there is much to explore. Remember, you come from
good blood. Stay strong!
Your loving father.

255

What a pathetic note, he thought, but it was all he could muster. He
only wished he could be there with his daughter who must feel abandoned
and broken in a strange country.

256

Chapter 47
Road to Perm, July 1941
The light reflecting off her pupils and the deep emerald green that
surrounded them, unlike the rest of her exterior sparkled like that of a young
girl after her first kiss and revealed that the rumors that had once been
spread about her, were probably all true.
The fire with the cast iron caldron on top, spit out flames. They would
need them to stay warm and cook the soup she was making from weeds she
collected that morning and a bone she had stolen from a dog. Tonight, Lillya
would sleep once again in an abandoned cabin with two women she had met
along the way. If only she hadn’t been such a familiar face, she thought, then
she could have traveled by train or boat, but unfortunately, now it was too
risky her scattered old brain still told her. It was safer to travel by horse and
with some companions. Besides she wouldn’t be staying long, none of them
would, she told herself.
After gathering more wood for the night and eating what could barely
be dubbed as supper, Lillya prepared for a long uncomfortable night. The
sofa that would double as her bed, had springs popping through the worn
fabric that were just annoying enough to wake her up no matter what side
she was laying on. Still, as she had found out the night before, it was better

257

than sleeping with the mice that were scurrying across the planks on the
floor below.
Things hadn’t turned out as she had imagined, but she spent little time
feeling sorry for herself. She had witnessed horrors and here she was still
alive holding onto a dream that fueled her body when it had nothing else.
However, she did take comfort in knowing her husband Anton, was not here
to see her in this predicament.
Many days and nights she would keep a low profile and keep on
going. She needed to find Natasha. Natasha would know what to do, but she
kept that thought to herself.
Lillya placed more logs on the fire before curling up on the sofa.
There was a distinct chill in the cabin and the women each took turns
through the night attending the fire so they wouldn’t freeze. Lillya tossed
and turned, then she heard an owl outside the window. It must be an Eagle
Owl just like the one that lived in the tree outside my bedroom when I was a
girl.
This led her to think of her father for he would imitate the owl when
he came to say his good nights to her, and his distinctive ooh-hu always
made her laugh. Some owls live to be 50 years old. I wonder if the old owl is
still alive. He might be the only one that remains. She smiled because the

258

night they left on what her father had named, “her adventure” he came out
early, flapped both his wings and hooted a loud fare-thee-well.
Lillya’s memories kept her going; that and the secret she shared with
Natasha. Perm, the town where Natasha spent the first three years of her life,
was on the western side of the Ural Mountain range but it was no longer
shown on any map.
Lillya was determined to find Natasha and she wouldn’t stop until she
knew that both she and their secret were safe. Then come spring she would
plant the sort of vegetables that grow near the mountains and come the
warmth of summer she would shed her heartache and in the dirt she would
bury all but her own best memories, even the ones of Anton that stopped her
from moving forward.
On this night, like many, she dreamed of memories of her friend.
Lillya loved the night, for she was not limited by the physicality and realities
of the day. At night she could go wherever she wanted to go, and her
subconscious was in charge. To her knowledge, her conscious self had very
little to say about it and each night came with a surprise.
The cold air in the cabin hit her nostrils like smelling salts and she
began to awaken. Lillya looked out the window, but it was still dark. Then
she heard the rattling snore of one of her roommates that sounded like a

259

volcano erupting and realized it wasn’t just the cold that had woken her up.
It was nearer to sunrise, but she still had some time before anyone would
expect anything from her.
Lillya lay quietly on the sofa and shut her eyes once again. The
erupting sounds of the women snoring represented inactivity in the cabin and
was actually welcome once she had admitted to herself that sleep was over
for the night, but it did not mean she couldn’t remain where she was and let
herself daydream and return to her childhood.
***

The path to Perm was a clear path. The directions she followed were
simply the description Natasha told her as a teenager, and much must have
changed since then. Lillya wondered if the shack where she was headed even
still existed and what made her think that all these years later Natasha would
be waiting. Still, as children Natasha made her memorize the directions to
her house, the one her great uncle on her mother’s side promised to leave
her.
“Perm is on the western side of the Ural Mountain range on the Kama
River. I’m told it’s the prettiest river in our country. Our winters are very
cold so be certain to pack your warmest clothes but in the summer be ready
for the heat for it gets very hot. Now repeat after me, when you enter the

260

town look for the new opera house. Everyone knows it. From there you will
head toward the mountain range and tell people you are looking for the
home of Peter Palitov, the miner. Each person you ask will get you a little
closer to his shack, which is located a short distance from his cave. My uncle
is a miner. This will be our meeting place should you ever need one. No one
would ever suspect it or come to look for you there.”
“Natasha you’re being silly.” Lillya said.
“You never know what life will bring you, if you are ever in danger,
you must go there. I will be waiting for you. There is that unspeakable bond
between us, I will know.”
***
Sometimes Lillya had to pull herself from the past. One of the women
who had spent the night with her last night decided that she was going in the
same direction as Lillya. Lillya was not too pleased, but she didn’t own the
forrest, or the roads and she couldn’t stop the woman from following her.
The woman, whose name was Katrina would have her uses. She was a good
shot, unlike Lillya.
Katrina couldn’t tell Lillya exactly where she was going and why, but
the same could be said for Lillya. So, in silence they both headed toward the

261

Ural Mountain range, Lillya in front with Katrina not far behind her, and for
now that was good enough.
Lillya didn’t have the slightest interest in befriending Katrina, the less
she knew, the better. Lillya didn’t trust her but then again, she had come to
trust no one, so Katrina was in the company of everyone in Russia except
Natasha.
Lillya tried to leave Katrina behind several times that first day. But
Katrina was nothing, if not cunning, and after a while Katrina began to chip
away at some of the stones that made up Lillya’s wall, besides, as much as
she didn’t want to admit it, Lillya was lonely. She had always had her father,
Natasha, Anton or Vladimir.
“It’s easier traveling with Katrina,” she began to tell herself, but still
she couldn’t quite reconcile the uneasy feeling she had in the pit of her
stomach. Everyone she ever loved was dead or had vanished. She thought
about Natasha and wondered if she was now the wealthy one between them.
Natasha’s status of maid would serve her better than pampered
dilettante who mingled with the nobles, whose great aunt was a Duchess and
whose uncle had married a widowed baroness. No, in this new Russia
Lillya’s past was something better kept to herself. She pretended to be
Natasha only with a different name, and tried to remember all that she

262

learned about the lower classes who now ruled post-revolutionary Russia.
However, Natasha was tutored like herself by the most notable tutors of St.
Petersburg, her father had insisted.
“Xenia,” Katrina laughed when she was alone. “Oh, how I, and most
every girl I knew wanted to be her when she was young. She has no memory
of me. I was just a dirty child helping my father shoe her father’s horses in
their barn.” But Katrina remembered how Lillya would sparkle when she
entered the stables.
She had heard rumors of Lillya’s affair and oh how she wished they
were friends, and she could hear the story from the lips of Lillya, but for
now she would just have to find happiness in knowing that the legend of that
story was sleeping beside her at night.
Lillya who had a proper education, in her present predicament listened
attentively to Katrina’s speech trying silently to imitate each and every
nuance, the way she strung her phrases, what subjects or verbs she omitted.
In her present disguise, she purposely spoke incorrect Russian and filled her
speech with the words that only peasants used. Just like them, Lillya
couldn’t help who she was born to, and she did her best to appear as
someone other than who she really was. It had become another challenge for
the notorious Lillya. Learn to speak as horribly as you can, she told herself.

263

Katrina was not very forthcoming herself. She spoke in half-truths,
but Lillya found it hard to fault her as her stories seemed to be more truthful
than her own. Katrina said that her father worked in St. Petersburg, and she
had been the daughter of a blacksmith, working class. “Business is
business,” Katrina said her father used to say. “As long as they pay, that
customer is good enough for me.”
Then one day a Red sympathizer showed up at the shop at the same
time as a White sympathizer and they got into an argument. Young boys and
not very good shots, when they both drew their guns, she was later told, they
both missed. Tragically, a bullet hit the cast iron pot over her father’s head,
ricocheted off the pot and went directly through her father’s heart killing
him on the spot. Both boys blamed it on the other and got into a fist fight
before realizing the trouble they could be in and when they heard the
policeman whistle, they both went running in opposite directions. “No one
wanted to take responsibility for the death of the beloved blacksmith,”
Katrina said. “He was known to be on the side of the paying customer and
tried to serve both sides professionally with regard. He was well liked by
all.” Katrina finished, wanting to add the phrase, “even by your father,” but
of course she did not.

264

Lillya assumed an identity that closely resembled Natasha’s story. It
was the one that she knew best. She was familiar with maids for they had
served her all of her life. She took her middle name and used it as her first
and borrowed the surname of her favorite butler, Borkovich. Yes, Xenia
Borkovich was much better than Lillya Engelhardt for there was only one
Engelhardt in St. Petersburg, and he certainly didn’t work the fields or clean
out the barn or manage the horses. Lillya’s new identity came from months
of planning with her husband and father. The evening she left her childhood
estate, her heart kept on beating, but everything else seemed to have gotten
lost except for her memories.

265

Chapter 48
Yuri’s townhouse, December 1909

Lillya sat by herself looking at pictures of her son in the family photo
album. Vladimir, Lillya and Anton’s only child, was born on a cold, rainy
night in 1888. The wind howled, almost as if it was singing a tune
addressing the gods and goddesses, praying that everything would be all
right.
Lillya not only suffered the pain of childbearing, but she suffered the
anguish of believing this might well be their only child. She had heard
childbirth could be quite painful, but she had had a very high threshold of
pain. In the process of the birth, as much as she loved the thought of being a
mother and couldn’t wait to do the job, she had decided that one heir was all
they needed.
But she did not let the pain get in the way of building a strong
relationship with her son, for she believed him to be a remarkable young
man with unusual talents and was the kind of boy who could touch the
insides of anyone who met him and make a prize out of anything small or
big. Lillya adored Vladimir and loved to watch him walk the wire which he
learned as a child from his father as it was the duty of every Vronsky man,
especially the heir, to follow in the tradition of the circus.

266

Vladimir was always jumping on logs, walking across nature-made
bridges that seemed to be bothersome to others, but were exactly what he
loved. He once saved a child from drowning and another from fear when the
boy’s house had caught on fire and Vladimir went where none of the other
boys would venture. To save the boy, he climbed up an old tall tree that had
one large branch that extended to the window where the boy was trapped
and screaming, and he walked across the branch and told the boy to calm
down; that everything would be safe, and he would be at home soon. It was
in Vladimir’s blood to want to save people, and this time he did. A lesson he
remembered well later in life.
But Lillya in the empty nights and somber moods behind and in front
of her often thought of the numerous nights she and Vladimir would sit by
the gigantic fire in their living room and play games of cards she had taught
him. Even in the cold she could feel the warmth of her son’s love for her.
As a boy, Lillya’s son liked to sing and dance and make up stories and
every once in a while, he convinced his friend Donatalia to make one up as
well. But his other favorite pastime came from the boy himself who loved to
tell stories and embellish the truths of what had happened for he knew he
could capture people’s imaginations with his words and the color of his
language. When he was nine, Lillya saved a letter he had written her, for he

267

had just learned to write and yet already she had something to put in the
collection that would over the years bring her great delight.
Dear Mama, he wrote, soon I’ll be ten… and he tried to spell out the
Imperial Theatrical School. Even as a young boy, Lillya had to help him
with his spelling though she knew that would be hard for any nine-year-old.
She found it rather funny that he could come up with these big ideas and
discover a way to make them come true, but he couldn’t spell the words of
what he was doing. He was a bright boy, she was certain of this, and one that
was empathetic to others and that made her happy. She liked boys that had
more girlish intuitions and she couldn’t wait to see what would come out of
him next.
But now it was time to pack all these things away and help her 19-
year-old boy get ready to take their family circus out of Russia and settle in a
new country where they would be safe and could continue the family
tradition.
Anton and Lillya proposed that Vladimir take a relatively small
touring company to perform in cities throughout Europe. This would allow
them to leave the country relatively inconspicuously and earn money as they
went. Vladimir wanted to bring his high-wire team, trapeze artists, acrobats,
clowns, horses and riders along with the necessary lions, tigers and

268

elephants. What was a circus without these essential elements? This would
amount to a cast of 40 performers, and they would need another 30
roustabouts, riggers and advance men. Adding in the menagerie and the
equipment, it would require eight entire railroad cars. This would be
expensive to prepare and launch, but it would give them a traveling home
that could take them from St. Petersburg to Warsaw, Berlin, Amsterdam,
Paris, Geneva, Vienna and Rome. They would paint the cars with colorful
depictions of the performers and their animals to create a rolling
advertisement for the show that would draw audiences to it as it rolled across
the countryside.
***
St. Petersburg, March 1910
Lillya, Anton and a legion of Vronsky Circus family members and
fans gathered at the train station to give one last cheer to the traveling
company that Vladimir was taking to perform across Europe. He took with
him the Kaminsky acrobats, the Volga clowns, flights of trapeze artists, a
dozen equestrians and of course there was Vladimir himself, the most
dazzling wire-walker in Russia, not to mention, six elephants and the tigers
Midnight and Satin.

269

They chose a route through many cities and towns and spent the
winter in the South of France. Unfortunately, that is also where Vladimir’s
cousin Victor ran off with a long-haired gypsy woman. Victor was a young
horseman who had had his heart broken.
They began to plan a passage by ship to America where they could
flourish and be safe. They would leave from Genoa, Italy and go to New
York. Then head south to a warm winter in a place like Georgia or even
Florida.
On the way to Genoa, they performed in Florence and on their day off
Vladimir went to see another circus and was enthralled and captivated by a
beautiful and magical horsewoman named Bella Cabrinzi. She rode into the
arena standing astride a pair of magnificent black Friesians. The horses wore
silver armor, and she was adorned with orange and blue silks. His heart
melted away when she performed fabulous riding stunts and amazing feats
of mounted archery.
Bella was the daughter of Sergio Cabrinzi, circus owner and one of
the greatest breeders in Italy. After the performance, Vladimir had Illya, his
second in command, request an audience with Bella to introduce himself.
Illya was not sure it was his job to be the advance man to Vladimir’s love

270

interest but knocked on the necessary doors and eventually persuaded people
to let them through with an adequate gift of Russian Vodka and caviar.
For his part, Vladimir was a bit tongue tied and could barely speak a
word of Italian – only the coos and baby talk of his Italian grandmother,
Petra, but that, too would have its use. She knew not a word of Russian but
could meet him at French and they ended up discussing horses and circuses
for hours. Later he even sang under her window, but he captured her heart
when he met with her father to purchase Senofonte the magnificent prize
Belgian. Sergio drove a hard bargain and Vladimir agreed to his price before
announcing his intention to marry Bella and present the horse to her as a gift.
Cabrinzi would sell the horse but was less willing to give away his
eldest daughter even if the horse stayed in the family. Unshaken, Vladimir
suggested a private performance of the Vronsky Circus for the Cabrinzi
family and their own circus. Illya was beside himself when Vladimir gave
him the instructions. How could he get the entire circus together to a
performance in just three days! And weren’t they planning on leaving soon
for America, what about that?
“Don’t worry, Illya, just tell them that they are invited to my
engagement party and might be invited to perform, if they stay sober
enough.”

271

In a few days, during which Vladimir rode every day and took every
meal with Bella, Illya and Bella’s sister Veronica made arrangements for the
performance/party. The evening began with a parade of horses then some
fancy riding, acrobats, clowns, appearances by the elephants and tigers and
finally, Vladimir doing something dazzling on the wire, disappearing in a
puff of smoke and reappearing on horseback leading Senofonte in without a
rider. He then dismounted, got down on his knee and asked Bella to marry
him and then he motioned for her to come down from her family’s box to
take her seat in the empty saddle on Senofonte.
The arena fell silent as Bella weighed the question.
Bella turned first to her mother and then to her father. Seeing no
objection, she stood, smiled at Vladimir and offered him her hand. The
audience and the performers burst out in cheers and raucous applause. They
ate, drank and celebrated until dawn. The next day Vladimir and Bella were
properly married in a small Roman Catholic chapel near the Cabrinzi Circus
with Illya as his best man and Veronica as Bella’s maid of honor.
As Vladimir began preparing for their departure for America Illya
knocked on the frame of his open door. Vladimir turned and smiled at his
old friend only to see an anxious look upon his face. Illya announced that he
would not be joining them on the trip to America. Vladimir was perplexed

272

until Illya mustered the nerve to tell him that he had asked Veronica to
marry him, and she had accepted. Vladimir shouted with joy for his friend
and embraced him. Veronica wanted to remain in Italy and Illya, still
entranced by the beauty and elegance of the country, happily agreed.
Perhaps they would join them in America someday, but for now, his heart
was bound to Genoa.
***
St. Petersburg, May 1911
The country was becoming unsteady and yet Lillya couldn’t bear
the thought that her own people could destroy themselves simply out of
greed. She cried at the anguish it would bring about but at night when she
rode her stallion with the wind blowing through her long wavy hair, and she
could hoot and holler as if she were a farmhand, the release of her true
feelings put a smile on her face for she was a determined girl who would
honor the love she and Anton gave to one another for, in her mind, he was a
king. He was fearless and Lillya respected and adored him not just because
she and Anton had made a beautiful child, but because he had the manners
and the fortitude to do something amazing, at least that’s what Lillya
thought. She felt good about having handed Vladimir the circus and looked
forward to his letters that didn’t come often now that he was a family man

273

and a businessman as well. But every couple of months she would find an
envelope that came from a stranger who had gotten it from another stranger
and somehow it had made it into her circus home and her own hands. She
loved getting letters like this, telling her about his wife and the family of
circus performers he had taken with him to America. The last letter she got
from him brought her happy news for he talked about his old childhood
friend and the daughter of her friend Katya, Donatalia Petrovskaya.
Savannah, Georgia, USA, April 21, 1911.
Dear Mother,
I am so happy to tell you that by a stroke of sheer good fortune, I have
been reunited with Donatalia Petrovskaya, the daughter of your dear friends
Pelé and Katya Petrovsky. The very same girl I danced with at the Winter
Palace before all this madness began. Donatalia had a terrible fall on board
the ship when she was traveling to America and broke her leg. She can walk
but, very sadly, her days as a ballet dancer have ended. Fortunately for the
circus, she has awakened her mental powers and has transformed herself
into a fortune-teller. She now occupies a tent devoted to reading the fortunes
of our patrons. She is a marvelous addition to our company and brings great
joy to all of us.

Chapter 49
Perm, August 1941

Lillya walked past the new opera house and came upon a grocery
stand along the highway occupied by an exceptionally large older man who
looked like he might have moved pianos for a living. Lillya examined the
variety of potatoes and carrots he had on display.

“Can I help you,” he offered.

“If you can sell me a few good potatoes.”
Then she paused, wondering if she should follow Natasha’s advice
and begin asking strangers for directions.
“Do you know the people of this area?”

“A few of them. Who in particular?”

“I seek the home of Peter Palitov, the miner.”

“Oh yes, Palitov. You are not far. Stay on this path but bear to the
right and when your path begins to rise steeply into the mountains you will
see a small wooden shack near a cave. He might not be around during the
daytime, don’t expect him to come out of his mine until after sunset.”

Lillya was delighted, this was just as Natasha had described. She paid
him a few rubles she’d earned teaching tricks to some young riders along the
way and noticed that he had a tattoo of a circus wire walker on his arm.

275

“You’re fond of the circus, I see.”

“Ah yes, my circus days, but those are long past and rather sad.”

“Sad? How could time spent with the circus be sad?”

“It was in America. I worked with a circus that endured much pain
and hardship. They were Russians but came to America to start over, as had
I, but tragedy struck them on two occasions, once with a daughter falling to
her death from the high wire and again with the father falling into a canyon
as he rescued his grandson. Then the circus folded up its tent and closed
forever, and I could not bear to continue living in America any longer.
Russia, for all its troubles was still my home and I had to return here to the
village of my parents.”

At this, Lillya was dumbstruck. This stranger seemed to be describing
her son’s own circus, but she did not know these tragic facts about them.
“That’s very sad. I myself have been with a circus and may know the
people you describe, but it has been many years since I’ve been in contact
with them. Will you tell me their name?”
“Of course, it was called the Circus of the Queens, but previously it
was known as the Vronsky Family Circus. Did you know them?”

276

Tears began to well up in her eyes. She was gasping for air and
struggling to get out simply the words, “Yes, yes, … they are my family, my
children, my grandchildren.” She sat down on the path and cried.
The potato vendor came around from behind his stall and bent down
to help her.
“Dear lady, I am so sorry to have brought you this grief. I loved your
son and his family and his circus. I will tell you all I can about them. They
used to live on a farm owned by the fortune-teller, Donatella but I have not
heard from them in several years.”
The vendor introduced himself as Boris and invited Lillya into his
cabin to eat and drink while he told her more of his memories. Over the next
hours, Lillya learned the story of the Circus of the Queens and her
marvelous granddaughters from this old Russian roustabout.
After many hours of food, vodka, laughter and tears Boris became
bold enough to ask her why she sought out Peter Palitov. Lillya confessed
that she didn’t know him or seek him personally, but that she was told to
come to Perm and ask for him if she was to find her old friend, Natasha.
Then Boris backed away from the table and burst out laughing. Natasha was
the greatest secret of Perm; a town so secret it was not on any map.

277

“Natasha Palitov is rumored to be the radical writer and revolutionary
known as The Falcon, famous for writing essays about the plight of the
illegitimate children and a leading figure in the administration of Comrade
Lenin. She was a decorated hero in the revolution, a confidante of Lenin’s
wife and an associate of Alexandra Kollontai who was the leader of the
women’s department of the Central Committee. Now, she like everyone else
in Perm was hiding. Sometimes, she was called upon by the government for
special favors but mostly she holed up in a cave in the mountains. No one in
Perm is supposed to know where she is, and usually we do not, but if you go
to Palitov’s shack and wait for him and then are able to prove your identity
and good intentions then he may lead you to her. But be wary, if he suspects
you are going to harm her, he will not hesitate to shoot you on the spot. He
has done that more than once. I will send word to Palitov that you seek her
and that I swear you to be a decent person. Besides, you are an old woman,
what risk could you pose.” Then he hesitated for a moment. “You don’t
intend to kill her, do you?”
***
Perm, August 1941
Lillya walked for several miles until she got to a shack in the foothills
that fit Boris’s description. She pounded on the door and walked all around

278

looking for this Peter Palitov, but no one came out, so she found a nearby
stump and sat. She sat until sunset which was after ten o’clock at this time of
year and she was about to pack up and return to Boris’s cabin when the front
door of the shack opened and out stepped Palitov, a pale, skinny miner in his
seventies carrying a military rifle from the Great War. Lillya fell off her
stump and he watched her carefully as she got to her feet and proclaimed her
identity and intentions. Palitov was skeptical. She had no papers but claimed
to be a baroness as if that would help her case and yet she possessed no
proof of anything or even direct knowledge of Natasha’s past that he could
verify.
Lillya sat back down on the stump and began crying. She had come so
far and now she would be deprived of her reunion because she lacked even a
prisoner’s identity card. Palitov was about to see her off when he mumbled
something about identifying marks and suddenly her face began to brighten.
“A mark? Yes, I have a mark,” she said. “It’s this heart shaped mole
on by back. Natasha would know it because she bathed me as a child. Come,
take a look at this and tell her you saw it. This will convince her!”
Palitov examined the mark on her back and retreated into his shack.
After an hour that seemed like an eternity to Lillya, Palitov came back out

279

and beckoned her to come inside. Natasha had given him permission to bring
Lillya to her.
Peter then led her to the back of his cabin and pulled a rug from the
floor and lifted up a door in the floor that revealed a staircase into a vast
underground labyrinth of tunnels and caverns, some natural, some man-
made, containing factories, living quarters and massive amounts of
machinery, material and food.
They could put an army down here; she said to herself before she
realized they probably had.
***
Natasha stood by an open-door in the side of the tunnel wall observing
Lillya being walked down the path toward her. She immediately recognized
her by her long strides, she walked like a rider and had the strong, bowed
legs to prove it. “There you are. I wondered if I would ever see you again.”
Lillya looked up from the path, smiled and took a deep breath. “I’ve
been looking for you for a very long time.”
“I know that I can be hard to find. I’m often hiding from others.”
Lillya laughed as she approached her old friend. Natasha stood,
looked at her, began to cry, as did Lillya and they embraced. She wrapped
Lillya in a blanket and helped her to a chair.

280

“But you are cold and hungry. Come let me draw you a bath and give
you some American biscuits. Good people these Americans. I can now see
why you sent your son there. My two sons died in our wars – one for the
Tsar and another for the Revolution. Thankfully, my daughter survived, and
her three boys are healthy but now they are of military age, and I fear that
they too will die for Russia.”
Natasha fed Lillya then gave her a bath and put her in her own bed.
Lillya lay in the bed barely awake but smiling blissfully as Natasha spoke to
her.
“Alas, I think the worst is still to come. You Lillya, however, are a
very old woman and you have suffered enough. I will find a way to send you
to America to see your grandchildren before you die. Will you trust me to do
that?”
Lillya weeps and nods submersing herself in the protective embrace of
Natasha that she has longed for since childhood.
Hours later she began speaking to Lillya. “I am so sorry that I have to
tell you this and so happy at the same time. Natasha, you are my cousin!”
Then she broke out crying and shaking and Natasha embraced her and
comforted her.
“I know” she said. “I know.”

281

“You did? How?” She stares blankly at Natasha then the light goes on
in her mind. “Your mother. Of course. I didn’t find out until after the
revolution and then I couldn’t find you. And I’m so sorry. You are my
cousin, a member of my family. You are not my maid or servant; you are my
equal in all regards and better in many. I’m so sorry, for all that has been
done to you and how you have suffered and endured.”
“Thank you, my dear cousin. It is good to speak of this.”
They talked late into the night and through the following days
sometimes breaking off to cry for long periods and sometimes playing
games and laughing hysterically as they had done as children.
After three days, Natasha told Lillya about seeing Yuri in prison and
making peace with him. She told Lillya that he was executed and that this
was even during the time that Lillya was herself in Peter and Paul Prison
which Natasha had not learned until later. But if she had known Lillya was
in prison, she would not have visited her. It would have been too painful and
there was nothing she could have done.
“Do you know what happened to Michael, my father?” Natasha asked
after a few days.
“No, just that he must have been captured by the Reds about the same
time I was. Maybe he escaped or paid them off somehow. Maybe he was

282

simply executed on the spot. That’s all I know about Anton, for that matter.
It’s a complete mystery to me.”
Both went silent over these newly remembered losses. Eventually,
Lillya spoke again.
“How’s your mother?”
“Dead, of course, but she lived until 1915 and had a happy life in
Odessa, though she never married or had any more children. She helped me
raise my children and that gave her much joy.”
***
“Let me tell you how I plan to get you out of here.” So, Natasha began
to tell the story of the Americans sending supplies to Russia via Arkangelsk
and how she could get Lillya on a ship to America.
A few days later they were on a train to Arkangelsk where Natasha
expected to find a certain American named Colonel Barstow and secure
passage for Lillya. As the train neared the port there was a delay –
something with the rails they said, and the train stood in place while hours
slipped away, and they feared Lillya would miss her ship to America. While
they waited a few Komi sleighs pulled up to the train offering food to the
travelers and Natasha saw her chance. She jumped from the train and had an
animated conversation with one of the Komi. She turned and waved to

283

Lillya, urging her to come down to the sleigh. When Lillya got there, they
packed her into the sleigh and Natasha began driving the reindeer out across
the snow-covered expanse toward their destination. They were joined by a
caravan of eight and drove until late in the night while the sun was still low
in the sky but when it set and the moon failed to rise, they were
overwhelmed by the hallucinatory beauty of the Aurora Borealis – ribbons
of green, blue and violet light shimmering across the entire sky and
reflecting off the endless flat table of snow.
As they approached the coast they could see miles upon miles of
parked trucks, pallets of rolled aluminum, acres of stacked tires and other
military supplies. Even though she had helped make the deal for these
goods, Natasha was still astonished by the massive size of this delivery.
When they arrived at the docks, the last ship was slowly pulling away
and their hearts sank. They watched, tearfully as the freighter slid out of the
port and into the White Sea. Natasha began calling for Colonel Barstow, but
he was nowhere to be seen. Finally, they gave up screaming and turned back
toward the village when an American army Jeep pulled up and Colonel
Barstow stepped out.
“Natasha! We couldn’t hold the boat any longer. I’m very sorry.
There won’t be another voyage until next Spring.”

284

“I understand. The fates were not smiling on us today.” Heartbroken,
she introduced him to Lillya and told him her story.
“You know,” he said smiling bemusedly at their grief, “if she doesn’t
mind being strapped into a seat for ten hours, she can fly back to Scotland
with me and hitch a ride to Canada with the pilots returning from ferrying
bombers over to the British.”
Natasha and Lillya were stunned speechless by their reversal of
fortune.

285

Chapter 50
Petrograd, September 1914
Lillya read about the assassination of Archduke Ferdinand of Austria
in Sarajevo by a Serbian nationalist. There were rumors that this could spark
a war between the Central Powers of Germany and the Austro-Hungarian
Empire and the alliance of France and England. How could Russia be pulled
into this? What side would they even be on? Nicholas II was the cousin of
Kaiser Wilhelm, the monarch of Germany. There was a delightfully silly
photo of them each dressed up in the military uniform of the other’s country.
Russians couldn’t fight Germans; our own empress was a German.
And yet, for reasons that still baffled her, the Tsar lined up on the side
of the French and English, purportedly on the grounds of Slavic solidarity
with the rebel Serbs. In a matter of months, the country was mobilized for
war. Maybe the leaders thought it was a welcome distraction from Russia’s
internal strife, maybe they wanted so much to be loved by the French and
Germans they would abandon their principles and sanity and go to war with
old friends and relatives.
The war began in late August with a disastrous offensive against the
Germans at Tannenberg. Pulled quickly into fighting, the Russian 2nd Army
was almost completely destroyed with as many casualties coming from the

286

tick-borne disease Typhus as actual combat. Soldiers lacked guns and
ammunition and were constantly under assault from the German’s powerful
artillery and machine-gun fire.
More defeats and worsening hunger fueled public outrage. No longer
trusting the competence of his own generals, the Tsar himself took command
of the army and left the governance of the country to his wife Alexandra
who was preoccupied with the health of her son Alexei, the heir to the
empire.
***
Yuri’s townhouse, October 1916
Yuri, Anton and Lillya realized that if they were to pass their family
fortune on to Vladimir and his children that they would have to find a way to
get some of their wealth to America soon, but this was not a simple matter.
The Okhrana, the Tsar’s secret police, monitored the movement of large
amounts of money out of the State Bank and the private commercial banks.
Sending a large amount of gold to America was expensive and risky and
would be deemed highly suspicious. They decided to convert a substantial
amount of money into precious gems and send them by private courier to a
bank in Charleston, South Carolina, a small city in the southern United

287

States that Vladimir was familiar with and would be easy for him to visit by
train.
They raised cash by selling several parcels of land and their remaining
shares in a textile firm run by Lillya’s friend Pelé Petrovsky, the father of
Donatalia and widowed husband of Katya. At the time, 100 Russian rubles
could be exchanged for about 50 US dollars. They decided to initially send
120 thousand rubles or 60 thousand dollars – equivalent to a metric ton of
gold at the fixed price of $20.67 US – more than enough to set up Vladimir
and his circus for life.
Yuri was a regular customer of the famed House of Fabergé but
decided that purchasing such a large volume of jewels from them would be
too conspicuous. Instead, they chose the House of Bolin. Edward Bolin was
a jeweler to the royal court and an old family friend. He personally assisted
them in selecting gems, necklaces and brooches containing diamonds,
sapphires, rubies and emeralds. Bolin thought their strategy was quite
shrewd, since a one carat diamond weighed just two tenths of a gram but
was worth about a kilogram of gold. They could literally pack diamonds
worth a ton of gold in a pouch weighing only 200 grams, about as heavy as a
potato. Bolin suggested one of his most trusted assistants, a certain André
Timashev, could make the voyage to America with the jewels safely stored

288

in a money belt that would never leave his waist. Yuri agreed to pay
Timashev a handsome sum and give him a first-class ticket to America and
back. Timashev had a wife and children in St. Petersburg and was sure to
perform his duty and return promptly with the receipt from the bank. Lillya
reluctantly parted with pearl necklaces, ruby and sapphire brooches and a
diamond tiara she had been given by the Tsarina, better that they be worn by
her granddaughters the Queens than hidden in a Russian vault.
The arrangements were made and Timashev set off for Charleston.
Because Russia was still at war with Germany, the only way to travel to the
US was via the Russian port of Arkhangelsk on the White Sea across from
Finland. Timashev would take a train to Moscow and then on to the port and
make the crossing on the SS Tsar. Tragically, a few days later it was learned
that he had been murdered in Moscow where he had stopped to change
trains. Of course, the jewels were never found, and no claim could be made
for them. One could only imagine that word of his precious belt had
somehow leaked out and made him a target of jewel thieves – or perhaps just
a lucky random robber. This was a crushing blow to all involved.
Yuri offered to compensate Andrés family but received a surprising
counteroffer from his eldest son Mikhail and his widow – they would agree
to take another package of jewels to America if he would finance moving the

289

entire family to the US and setting them up comfortably. A woman with six
children ranging in age from 12 to 25 would be much less vulnerable than
one man traveling alone and this time they would sew the jewels into their
garments and keep a tight lid on their secret. Yuri agreed. They got together
a similar package, and the family soon departed for America. After a fretful
month of waiting, they received a letter via courier containing a receipt from
the South Carolina National Bank of Charleston, a key to a safe deposit box
there and the front page of the Charleston Evening Post dated September 13,
1916, as proof of their safe arrival and fidelity.
Soon afterwards, Lillya composed a letter:
October 23, 1916
Dearest Vladimir,
We have come to believe that our Russia, the Russia you were raised
in and taught to hold in high esteem, will soon be no longer.
We hired at a considerable sum a man – who for obvious reasons will
remain nameless – to make a delivery to a bank in Charleston, South
Carolina. The bank is located at the corner of Broad and State Streets. This
key will unlock a box registered in your name and inside you will find our
gift. In case something happens to us, this should secure your future and that
of the circus.

290

Presently, Russia is dangerous, and travel is out of the question. When
this upheaval comes to a peaceful end, we will reunite, if possible. Be safe,
son, and give our love to your wife and family. You are in our hearts.
Your loving parents
She didn’t say that this shipment cost one man his life and brought
about the moving of his family to America. At least now she could rest
assured that her family in America would have all the money they needed to
live a very comfortable life. The Timashev’s later wrote that they very much
liked Charleston, bought a nice home there in The Battery and set up a
jewelry store on a fashionable block south of Broad Street.
***
Petrograd, January 1917
Lillya and Anton arrived for the holiday celebration at the Winter
Palace. The death of the healer Rasputin was casting a pall over the Tsar’s
household, but most of the other nobles thought it was a cause for
celebration. Lillya knew it was politic for them to make an appearance, but
the Tsar and Tsarina would likely remain in their private chambers with their
children. She requested a short audience with Empress Alexandra and her
children to express her sympathy and concern but was turned away, like
many other friends of the family.

291

Chapter 51
Arkangelsk, September 1941
Lillya and Natasha spent their last night together in an empty
American barracks at the port. This surprise gave them one last night
together and with that came a boldness on Lillya’s part to learn something
that had gnawed at her ever since she learned that Michael was Natasha’s
father. How did Natasha come to be and why was she treated as a servant,
not as the cousin she actually was?
Natasha was at first startled by the question, but she acknowledged
that she had started wondering about her father as a teenager. She knew that
she and Lillya had different stations in life, despite their strong bond, but
being such an important part of Lillya’s household, it didn’t occur to her
until she was 13 or 14 that she must have a father somewhere, too. The more
she wondered about it, the more often the question would bubble up in her
consciousness. She had asked her mother once, but she and her mother
weren’t accustomed to serious conversations, and Sonya waved her off
instead of answering. Natasha was surprised at how angry those interactions
made her. She had a right to know where she came from.
The question had come up in conversation with Lillya, too. After
Natasha had gotten no answer from her mother, she confided in Lillya. The

292

two had imagined all kinds of situations that could have led to Natasha’s
conception and all kinds of men that could possibly be her father. What if
her father was really the Tsar? They giggled with glee at the thought that
Natasha may actually have royal blood. Or maybe the awful baker who
would notoriously sneer and bark at the servants who would go there to buy
the bread for the day? Natasha cringed. Surely her father was a good man,
someone worthy of respect. There must be a reason he wasn’t around—a
good reason, if it meant leaving his daughter in the care of Yuri. Or
maybe… was it something about her that made her father leave? The
thought made Natasha’s heart sink, and she told Lillya that she didn’t want
to talk about it anymore. “At least we’ll always have each other,” Lillya had
said, grasping Natasha’s hands in hers. Natasha was partly convinced, but
still had a gaping hole in her heart wondering about her father. When she
was torn away from Lillya, that hole gaped all the wider.
In Odessa, Natasha faced her mother with the question again, but this
time she was even more desperate to get the information out of her, and
more angrily insistent. She simply had to know, and her mother would tell
her this time, it was as simple as that. Natasha was convinced that some deep
truth would come to light as soon as she knew her father’s identity, and she
simply couldn’t go any longer without knowing.

293

Seeing the desperation and insistence in her daughter’s eyes, Sonya
knew she couldn’t hold it back any longer. She sighed. “My darling, sit
down. Let me tell you how you came to be.” Natasha sat at her mother’s
feet, holding her hand, tears in both their eyes.
“I’ve never spoken of it, but I think you’ve always known that I am
Komi,” she said, referring to the indigenous Finnic people of the North.
“When you were very young, I spoke to you in Komi and sang you Komi
lullabies. Don’t you remember them?” She sang a few bars of a Komi tune.
Natasha’s eyes widened in her sudden comprehension and tiny tears
emerged from their corners. “Komi was your first language, but you have
always been good at picking up new tongues.”
Sonya spoke affectionately of growing up in the Komi village of
Kudymkar near Perm. She was the daughter of a Komi reindeer herder
named Viktor and his wife Elena. When she was 7-years old, her parents
sent her to the Orthodox school for Komi children in Perm where she
learned to read and write Russian and a variety of domestic trades. She was a
good pupil and very pretty.
“Your grandparents helped me care for you in our village until you
were four. Do you remember my father taking you for rides in our sleigh or
helping him tend to the reindeer?” Sonya went to a drawer and took out a

294

colorful Komi shawl. “My mother gave this to me when we left. You can
have it now. Would you like it?” Natasha took the shawl and wrapped
herself in it.
Sonya continued, “I was sent to Yuri by the school in Perm. He hired
me to help clean out his family’s old mansion in Perm while he oversaw new
construction at the family’s coal mine. When he was about to return to St.
Petersburg, he invited me to join him, and I eagerly accepted.
“He had been courting your mother Angelika before he left and when
he returned, he presented me to her as a gift. I served as Angelika’s favored
Lady’s Maid and quickly became her confidante. Yuri’s greatest rival for her
affection was his cousin Michael.”
When Sonya first said Michael’s name she paused and couldn’t speak
for a moment. Sonya would often accompany Angelika, Yuri and Michael
on walks and to concerts and galleries. Sometimes Michael would speak
directly to Sonya and even flirt with her to get Angelika’s attention. There
was a lot of playful joking amongst them but as Angelika’s heart seemed to
sway irretrievably toward Yuri, Michael grew anxious and did something
foolish, something that could never be undone.
When she said this, Sonya began tearing up again and needed to walk
away. Natasha followed her outside. She was not angry with Michael,

295

perhaps she was even still in love with him after all that had passed.
Angelika could see immediately that Sonya was not familiar with these
matters and was appalled by what Michael had done. Yuri shared Angelika’s
concern for Sonya, saddened that his bringing her from Perm had led to this.
When Sonya showed her first signs of pregnancy Angelika set her up
to stay with a family of domestic servants they knew in St. Petersburg. When
Natasha was born, Angelika, who was herself then pregnant with Lillya,
came to accompany Sonya to a foundling home where she could put Natasha
up for adoption. But when Angelika saw the condition of the home and
realized that very few of the infant girls were adopted or even survived, she
held Natasha in her arms and told Yuri that this Englehardt daughter needed
to stay in the family.
Yuri was befuddled but decided that they could send Sonya and
Natasha back to Perm to live with Sonya’s parents. When Michael learned of
all this, he was annoyed at first, but ultimately grateful to Yuri and Angelika.
Michael saw Sonya and the infant one more time before they returned
to Perm and tried clumsily to explain why she and Natasha could not stay
with him. He had become engaged to someone else, an heiress named
Margaretta, but the pain he felt saying goodbye to his daughter made him
secretly vow to care for his future children better than he had Natasha.

296

A few years later, Angelika felt that she could not bear another child
and recalled Sonya and Natasha to St. Petersburg so that Lillya, who had no
siblings, could grow up with her cousin as a childhood companion, even
though Natasha’s parentage could not be acknowledged.

Natasha smiled and said that in the first years she lived in Odessa she
would get lost in her own mind. She had always thought she would stick
with Lillya, perhaps moving into a new home with her once Lillya married.
She had never even considered marrying herself. Natasha shook her head, in
those days all I could think was “Who would want to marry an illegitimate
handmaid?”
***
In a few hours, they said one last tearful goodbye and Lillya boarded
the plane, never to see Russia again.
Ascending in the airplane was the most astonishing and euphoric
experience of Lillya’s life. Looking out over the vast expanses of earth and
sea made her feel as though she was being transported to another world and
of course, she was.
***
Gander Newfoundland, September 1941

297

Lillya’s plane landed at Gander in Newfoundland, Canada. When she
stepped out of the plane, trembling and weakened by many long cold hours
strapped into a tiny seat, she was met by a group of US Army officers who
took her into a small military hut where she tried unsuccessfully to
communicate with them in broken French and English, saying simply
“circus of queens” over and over again to the complete befuddlement of her
hosts.
Eventually, a 19-year-old Russian boy in a US Army uniform was
brought in to ask her questions on behalf of his American superiors. She was
interrogated about Russia and her reasons for coming to the US until she
could no longer stay awake despite drinking cup after welcome cup of hot
coffee and even smoking cigarettes again after more than 20 years.
***
Savannah, GA, September 1941
After a week in Canada, Lillya was flown to the US Naval Air Station
in Charleston, South Carolina. The Navy confirmed the existence of a
woman named Donatalia Petrovskaya and a former circus known as the
Circus of the Queens. A few military people spoke around her and over her
head about what to do next when one of them picked up a telephone and
called the operator for Savannah, after a few minutes of chatter from which

298

Lillya could only make out a few references to a circus and Russians, he
covered the mouthpiece of the phone and asked her, “Do you know someone
named Donatella?”
Lillya was baffled for a moment and then screamed out “Donatalia!”
The officer said, “Sounds close enough.”  Then he spoke into the
mouthpiece again, “There’s someone here who wants to speak with you.”
and handed Lillya the phone. Donatalia said “Hello, this is Donatalia.”
cautiously into the phone in English only to have Lillya burst into tears and
begin speaking rapidly in Russian. She couldn’t hold herself back and would
have told Donatalia her entire life story if the officer hadn’t taken the phone
back from her and gotten some more information from Donatalia. He then
arranged for her to be brought to the farm in Savannah the next day.
A short time later she was driven by a boyish Corporal Fitzsimmons
in a US Army Jeep to Donatalia’s doorstep. Her granddaughter Ann Marie
Heart met her at the door holding in her arms the baby Scarlett, her first
great granddaughter. Lillya was overcome with joy. The Corporal
Fitzsimmons put small bags, which included some trinkets and gifts from
her hosts in Canada and departed while they stood there staring in
amazement, barely able to exchange affections. Donatalia arrived and
welcomed them in.

299

Lillya was served delicious southern fried chicken and numerous
other unfamiliar dishes by Donatalia’s housekeeper Polly and could barely
tell her stories while marveling at the room and land around them. After
lunch Ann Marie’s husband Kyle and their young son Kyle Jr join them and
Lillya is quite taken by their charm and grace. Vladimir’s wife Bella had just
returned from Italy and is herself filled with joy to meet Lillya. Donatalia’s
husband Marvin was running errands in town and would join them for
dinner.
Lillya was exhausted but still too excited to sleep, so Donatalia
showed her around the farm and introduced her to the remaining circus
animals, especially the elephants Emily and Bess. Lillya asked about
Midnight and Satin but, of course, they had both passed away years before.
Finally, Donatalia showed her the flower garden and where Vladimir
and Spade were buried. She knelt at their graves and when she arose, she
asked if she too could be buried there. “Of course, you can,” Donatalia told
her, “But that won’t happen anytime soon.” Lillya laughed that she would
have so much longer to live after seeing the passing of her husband, son and
granddaughter. What kind of good luck is this, she thought.

Chapter 52
Petrograd, February 1917
Natasha stood along the front of the surging line of protesters at the
Narva Gate. They faced a long line of soldiers with rifles drawn. A proud
captain of the Volhynian Lifeguard Regiment of the Imperial Guard rode his
grandly costumed stallion out in front of them and brandished his saber.
After several stern orders to the crowd to retreat went unheeded, the officer
raised his pistol in preparation for the order to fire. The line of soldiers
raised their rifles evoking the horrible memories of 1905. But this time,
before the order to fire could be given, one brave unknown son of Russia,
some anonymous Alex, Pasha or Peter, defied his captain and defied his Tsar
by firing his rifle into the air. And with that one brave man’s act of courage,
the spell of the Romanov’s was broken. The officer swung around and aimed
his pistol at the offending soldier but as he did one, then another, then all the
other soldiers in the line fired into the air in a breathtaking cascade of
defiance. The officer abruptly pulled back his pistol. Seeing the rifles of the
line now pointed toward him, he spurred his horse to gallop and quickly rode
away. The crowd cheered. The demonstrators ran to embrace the soldiers in
celebration. They knew immediately that the revolution had succeeded.

301

Three long centuries of Romanov rule were over, and, for a moment, all the
people of Russia were free.
Chaos reigned as 60,000 soldiers and officers of the Petrograd
Garrison mutinied and took control of the arsenal, the police and the main
government ministries. Tsar Nicholas quickly returned to Petrograd, but it
was too late, all he could do was abdicate and give control of the country
over to a provisional government run by the Duma. The Germans sent Lenin
back to Petrograd. Some saw this as a cynical ploy to get the Russians out of
the war. Nonetheless, the Bolsheviks welcomed him back and he led them
with fervor.
Yuri was a member of the Duma from the Constitutional Democratic
Party also known as the Cadets, a progressive party of professionals and
intellectuals.
Lillya didn’t follow politics that closely but agreed with her father on
most issues and obviously believed that Russia needed a Tsar and royal
family, the same way Britain needed its King and Germany its Kaiser.
Though she did agree that the country needed a stronger parliament and that
perhaps Nicholas II had not been as sensitive to the people’s needs as he
should have been.

302

Anton was skeptical of governments in general and steered clear of all
political conversations, in part because his employees in the circus had wide
ranging views and he was sympathetic to all of their feelings.

The wild card was the army. The pre-war army of volunteers and
professional soldiers had mostly been killed or wounded by 1917 and a new
army of conscripts who were both younger and older than regular soldiers
had taken their place. They joined with workers in the Petrograd Soviet and
brought about Order Number One, an edict that allowed army units to elect
representatives to the soviets and demanded that officers no longer had to be
addressed as “Your Excellency” but rather as “Sir” and required officers to
address soldiers using the formal “vy” instead of “ty” and only require
saluting when on duty. In general, this democratization of the army led to a
breakdown in discipline including the execution of disliked and distrusted
officers. The country was in complete disarray. Soldiers deserted en masse
and returned to their families leaving hollowed out units at the front and a
rebellion among the troops in the capital.
***
On October 24th, after months of street skirmishes between the various
factions the Provisional Government’s police raided the Bolshevik
newspaper offices, smashing machinery and presses. Stalin escaped with one

303

of the printing presses and joined Lenin in a meeting of the Central
Committee in the Smolny Institute just a few kilometers from the Winter
Palace. Trotsky and some of the other Mensheviks who had previously
resisted the use of violence to overthrow the provisional government agreed
now that a coup was the only way to bring an end to the war and the ongoing
madness.
That night Natasha served as one of many translators and interpreters
to the Central Committee as they directed Bolshevik militia units to seize the
Petrograd electric power station, main post office, state bank, telephone
exchange and several bridges. A ship they controlled, the Aurora, sailed up
the Neva and opened fire on the Winter Palace as militia members stormed
the building. The Provisional Government’s delegates, Yuri Englehardt
among them, surrendered and were arrested. Alexander Kerensky, their
Prime Minister, managed to escape.
***
Petrograd, November 1917

The Petrovsky & Sutton Spinnery was now run by a committee of
workers, and they took more interest in the political activity of its members
than the production of quality textiles. Pelé had resisted at first but once the
police and the army had gone over to the other side, there was no one to

304

defend the rich the nobles and bourgeoisie from the hungry, angry mob that
now felt entitled to take anything and everything that had belonged to
someone who had more than they had. His own home was invaded by a mob
that proceeded to move in four families of strangers. He considered himself
lucky to still live there in the old servants' quarters. One of his new
neighbors was a former tailor named Pavel who had been an admirer of the
cotton cloth made by the Petrovsky & Sutton Spinnery. He had sympathy for
Pelé and took an interest in his well being.
On one occasion Pelé told him all about his daughter Donatalia who
he had sent to America many years before, who had been a very talented
ballet dancer but sadly broke her leg on the voyage and now survived as a
fortune-teller in the Circus of the Queens that toured the southern United
States. He told Pavel how much he missed her and how proud he was of her.

Well into is fifties now with a life spent working on a factory floor,
drinking and smoking too much, Pelé fainted one day while shouting at the
Bolshevik who’d fallen asleep in his favorite chair. Mme. Strachkov and her
sister were called and together they carried him to the street and hailed a
carriage to take him to a doctor. The emergency room looked like a military
field hospital with sick and injured people crowding all the rooms and
hallways. After a few hours, an exhausted female doctor assessed that he

305

would be dead soon and not worth a bed but after a day passed and he still
hung onto life they assigned him a cot in an enormous overflowing ward of
coughing, wheezing and crying peasants, revolutionaries and nobles. They
fed him when they could and eventually, he felt well enough to leave under
his own power. Madame had come to visit him in the hospital every day for
a month and implored him to move in with her and her sister but the day
before he was to be released she must have been distracted by all her plans
and preparation because she walked out in front of a horse and carriage
going at a rather fast clip and was killed instantly. When he was given the
news, it was too much sorrow for Pelé to take. He walked out of the hospital
a broken man and never returned to his old home. That afternoon he walked
through the streets of Petrograd until he reached his beloved factory, his
spinnery. The floors were littered and the machines he nurtured like children
now sat in disrepair and neglect. He ached to see bales of fine cotton
decomposing in the storage bins because there was no one to wash and
process it, let along turn it into crisp white sheets or fine garments. He
walked up and down the production lines, unrecognized and barely noticed
until he sat down on a workman’s bench and had a heart attack. He died
quickly and silently among the machines that were all that he had left of a

306

family thinking in the end of his beloved wife Katya and the daughter
Donatalia he saw off to America twelve years before.

A few weeks later, noticing that he had not returned, Pavel penned a
letter to Donatalia hoping that it would find her if he addressed it simply,
Circus of the Queens, c/o General Post Office, Charleston, South Carolina,
USA.
***
Yuri’s Townhouse, Petrograd, April 1918
Eventually, the Red Army arrived at the door of Yuri’s townhouse and
ordered him to vacate the property as it was being seized by the new
Bolshevik government. He packed a single bag and made it out to the
country estate with a few suits of clothing, some of his late wife Angelika’s
jewelry and photographs of her and his daughter Lillya with her husband
Anton and his grandson Vladimir when he was a child.
Fortunately, he saw that Lillya and her husband were sent off to safety
in the east. In short order, the Bolsheviks began rounding up the landowners
and nobles in the vicinity of the city. The Tsar and his family were moved
from Tsarkoye Selo to a location east of the Urals to take them out of play
while the Reds fought the remnants of the Imperial Army and other
monarchists.

307

Yuri was eventually arrested at his estate, as he had expected, and
unceremoniously taken into custody. A fledgling judge of the new regime, a
beardless young man with poor grammar and shabby clothes beneath his
torn, food-spattered robe read out the indictment with a haughty leering tone.
“Yuri Englehardt, you stand here accused of being an enemy of the
socialist revolution that has liberated the people of Russia from the
oppressive regime of Tsar Nicholas II. You have abused the privileges
granted to you and your family and stolen land, wealth and resources from
the people of Russia. What say you to these charges?”
Standing handcuffed before a minor magistrate new to his position
and role, he made the case for his own freedom.
“My family has served the Tsars and the people of Russia since the
13th Century. In 1714, Peter the Great gave my ancestors the property we
now inhabit as payment for service in the war against the Swedes that led to
the founding of our city. We have been good stewards of the land and fair
masters of our serfs and servants. When Alexander II freed the serfs in 1862,
I was only 14, but my family happily liberated the thousands of serfs that
had worked our lands and mines and served our community for generations.
We opened schools to educate them and their children and even sent the
most able of them to study at universities. Even now, we welcome into our

308

home the families of former serfs that work the lands we granted to them
along with the lands my family has retained. I pledge my loyalty to the new
government of Russia and its people.”
The magistrate chuckled, “You were a member of the Duma and
possess wealth beyond comprehension. You resisted the revolution and
sought to arrest and murder its leader. You are a stain on the fabric of
Russia.” He pronounced Yuri guilty of all charges and ordered him to be
held at Peter and Paul Prison pending execution. As he was escorted out a
neighbor and Duma compatriot was moved into the dock.
***
Peter and Paul Prison, October 1918
When Natasha showed up at the door of Yuri’s cell, she was wearing
the uniform of a Red Army Major. She had been awarded a medal and a
promotion for her exploits on the Northern Front. At first, Yuri couldn’t
recognize her and wondered what this officer had come to do to him.
“Yuri Englehardt, you are a prisoner of the People of Russia. I have
come to speak with you for the purpose of gaining information to benefit the
revolution.” The guard opened the door and admitted Natasha to his cell.
She motioned to the guard to leave them alone.

309

“Do you recognize me, Yuri?” He looked closely at her face but the
thirty years that separated their last meeting made it impossible for him to
recall who she was. She removed her cap and shook her short mane of salt
and pepper hair. “When you said goodbye to my mother and me, I’m sure
you never expected to see me again.”
Perhaps it was her voice or a small facial gesture, but a light flickered
on in his memory and his eyes widened. “Natasha? Natasha! It’s you. I’m
sorry, I’m sorry. I don’t know what to say. I… I…”
Natasha became uncomfortable with his crying and stammering.
“Yuri, I have not come to help you. There is nothing I can do or say to alter
your fate. I have only come to settle some questions. First of all, who is my
father?”
Yuri is shaken and unable to speak except to feign ignorance. “I don’t
know, I’m sorry, but I don’t know.”
“Are you, my father?”
“No. No. Of course, not. How would you even think that?
“Is your cousin Michael my father?”
Now, Yuri is sweating despite the cold and uncertain about what to
say.
“Why do you say that? What have you heard?”

310

“My mother tells me that Michael is my father, but I was not sure.
Now, I believe that is more likely.”
Yuri asks her, “Do you know where he is? Is he alive?”
She shakes her head. “I don’t know.”
“Lillya? Do you know what has happened to Lillya and her husband,
Anton?”
“I don’t. If I did, I would tell you. There is little that I know and less
that I can do.”
“I’m so sorry for everything that I did to you. I wanted to right a
wrong, but there was no way to do it painlessly. I only ask that you now try
to forgive me and not think ill of my daughter who always loved you
dearly.”
“I no longer bear you any ill will. You did what you thought you
needed to do in the circumstances. My life could have been much worse
without your intervention. I must leave you now. There is nothing else to
say.”
She nods her head toward him. He wanted to reach his arms out to
embrace her, but that would not have been appropriate. He nodded and his
eyes filled with tears. She left the cell shaken and sad for Yuri and her

311

country and what the coming years might bring now that the Bolsheviks had
assumed power.
***
As they spoke, Lillya walked the prison yard, appreciating her few
minutes of daily sunlight. The next day Yuri was executed by firing squad
and buried in a mass grave on the prison grounds.
After they were captured in Kungar, Anton and Father Nikolai were
forced into service in the Red Army and were killed in action fighting the
Czech Army on the Eastern Front. Lillya never learned their fates. Michael
was deemed too old and unfit for military service and was executed by a
pistol shot to his head. The Reds gleefully confiscated most of the group’s
hidden wealth in jewels and gold coins, but Gretta still managed to keep
some secreted away.
Gretta returned to Petrograd and brought Helena and Lana with her.
They lived there until 1941, when they were killed by German bombing.
Lillya, recalling how they had run away from her that day in Petrograd,
wondered if they had been complicit in her being identified and captured,
but she never learned the truth.

Epilogue
Donatalia’s farm, Savannah, GA, Thanksgiving 1941
Donatalia and Ann Marie Heart were cutting peaches and pears for
Thanksgiving dinner. A turkey was roasting in the oven – for the first time in
three years. Kyle, Jr., and his sister Scarlett played with carved wooden toys
on the dining room floor.
Lillya came downstairs, her hair wet and wrapped in a towel from her
shower, too curious and aroused by the sounds of cooking and conversation
to remain in her bedroom. She smiled with deep delight at the sights and
smells of this peculiar American holiday that she was celebrating for the first
time.
From the kitchen, Donatalia called to Lillya, “There’s a nice dress of
Irena’s laid out for you on my bed. Help yourself to any of my jewelry. Just
be back downstairs in 15 minutes.” Lillya went back upstairs to Donatalia
and Marvin’s bedroom to put on the dress lent to her by Donatalia’s late
mentor and benefactor. The dress was an ornate Russian gown from the last
century. Lillya felt like she was once again dressing for dinner at the Winter
Palace. Then she noticed the contents of a jewelry box and one particular
item stood out to her. She donned some stylish modern earrings and put the
familiar looking item on the dresser top. When she got downstairs, she told

313

Donatalia that she saw an emerald brooch in her jewelry chest that reminded
her of one she had long ago.
“It should look familiar; you gave it to my mother years ago and she
passed it on to me. There’s quite a story to go along with it, too. Remind me
to tell you about it later.” Lillya turned ashen. Was this the same emerald
brooch she had been given by Laurent?
After a sumptuous Thanksgiving feast Lillya eagerly awaited
Donatalia’s story of the brooch. She told her all about her interactions with
Herve Laurent Fleury from the encounter on the steamship when she broke
her leg to the poker game with Vladimir and the misadventures with the
elephants Emily and Bess. Later, she showed her the letter Herve gave her
when he returned the brooch just a few years ago, before he returned to
France. Lillya trembled with a combination of anger and fear. She poured
over the letter. It began,
Dear Donatalia, or is it Donatella now? My full name is Herve
Laurent Fleury. I bought this for whom I thought would be the love of my
life, Lillya. I gave it to her the day we took vows in the forest….
Lillya began to weep and then growl and spit with ferocious anger as
she poured over the rest of the letter and discovered what Herve had done in

314

his bitterness over losing her. Donatalia stood near trembling and stunned
into silence.
Later Harsita joined them and reported that Herve had returned from
France last year after the German invasion and now ran a small riding
academy in Charleston. Lillya asked Harsita to take her there the following
Monday.
***
Lillya and Harsita found seats in the bleachers and watched as Herve
Laurent Fleury, now known as Larry Flowers, put a young brother and sister
through their paces. The proud parents clapped, and Laurent walked over to
them. After chatting for a few minutes with the mom and dad, he came over
to Lillya and Harsita. “Looking to get riding lessons for your young fella,”
he asks Lillya, not at all recognizing her from over 50 years before.
In her still excellent French, Lillya replied, “Not at all, Laurent. Surely, you
know that I can teach him dressage quite well myself.” Laurent sat up,
frozen upon his horse, and stared intently at Lillya.
“Lillya?” Laurent began to tremble as she looked at him somewhat
ruefully. “Is it really you? What are you doing here?”
“Looking for you, of course. I have something to return to you.”
Lillya takes the emerald brooch out of her pocket and holds it out to him.

315

“But I…”
“Can you leave us for a moment, Harsita? I have a few things of a
personal nature to discuss with Mr. Flowers.” Harsita stood up and walked
away to look at some of the other horses in the stable. On his way out, he
nodded to Laurent who suddenly recognized the young Indian man as
Donatalia’s elephant mahout.
“I don’t want that now. I gave it back to Donatalia, you can have it or
do whatever you want with it.”
“I have no interest in a cursed jewel that has brought so much pain to
my loved ones and perhaps, to you, as well.” She let the brooch fall onto the
dusty ground of the corral.
“I’m sorry, Lillya, I don’t fully know what got into me. I was
overwhelmed by you, your beauty and your magical powers. I thought I
meant something to you. I only ever wanted to bring you joy and happiness.
But when that was not possible, I became bitter and jealous. It consumed
me. Why did you never answer my letters or communicate with me? How
could you have just disappeared like that, after we both swore vows of
love?”
Lillya suddenly felt sorry for this pathetic looking old man. “I wrote
to you several times and poured out my sorrow and anguish, but my father

316

never let my letters get to the post office nor did he ever let me receive any
letters from you. He dismissed your brooch as a worthless bauble and told
me to throw it away. If I had known… But I was so distressed then, you took
me by surprise. I was only 16 Laurent! You were a grown man! I had
promised my love to someone else, someone in Russia, long before I met
you. I valued you, Laurent, I even cared for you, but not in that way. Not in
a way that could cause me to abandon my previous life and become your
wife. I’m sorry, but that was never possible, and I could never have
explained it to you, not in that moment or ever. I was so young, in that
moment I was helpless, even now, 50 years later I cannot see how I could
have behaved differently. I was delirious but also mortified. My father
thought he needed to rescue me from you, and he gave no consideration to
your feelings or mine. He was cruel to both of us, and he has paid for his
cruelty to you and others, of that I can assure you.”
Laurent was visibly moved by her words and looked into her eyes
sheepishly with a combination of guilt and understanding.
“Why didn’t you just grow up, Laurent! Why didn’t you just tell
yourself “C’est la vie”4 as you French always say and get on with your life?

4 That’s life.

317

I meant you no harm and did not intend to deceive you. I appreciated
everything you taught me and put it to good use.”
“You did do that,” he quipped sarcastically back at her.
“As I should have, and as you must have intended, but just not in the
service of your personal glory. I said I was sorry once; I won’t say it again.”
With that Lillya got up to leave.
“No. No! Not like this, we can’t part like this. I have wanted my entire
life to speak to you, but I never thought I would see you again. Now, to my
astonishment, you are here, and I can’t let my life end like this. I loved you,
Lillya, more than I thought I would ever love another human being and more
than I have loved anyone since, but I understand now. It was not meant to
be. You were never meant to be mine and I accept that now, after so many
years of anger and bitterness. Forgive me. You meant me no harm. I am so
sorry for all the pain my vain jealousy and heartbreak caused.” He turned
away to hide the tears streaming down his face.
Lillya now cried herself, thinking of all that transpired between them
and what it meant to her life. “I forgive you. I’m sorry, this should never
have caused us all so much pain. It was just a simple misunderstanding. You
didn’t understand and I couldn’t explain it to you. Not then.”

318

They sat in silence, breathing slowly and deeply to settle the feelings
that had festered and roiled within them for half a century.
After a moment, he looked up at her and smiled. “Do you still ride?”
Lillya wiped away a tear and brightened. “Of course, I still ride.”
“Then here, take a turn with my fine Kentucky Quarter Horse,
Bourbon.” He got off his horse and offered her the reins.
“He is quite a fine looking fellow.” Lillya walked down from the
bleachers, took the reins of the horse and climbed onto the saddle. After she
whispered in his ear, she gave him a command and off she went, cantering
around the rink. Laurent broke into a big smile as his prize pupil displayed
her gifts and knowledge still obvious at the age of 71.
She looked back and smiled at him, seeing again the earnest young
Frenchman who had taught her this marvelous way of riding and
communicating with horses, the magical creatures she had loved since
childhood.
The End

319

The Emerald’s Story
The emerald was mined from the Panjshir Valley of Afghanistan, cut in
Bombay, mounted into the ornate silver brooch in Constantinople and
acquired in a trade involving horses and camels by an Ottoman Sultan. It
was stolen from the Sultan’s palace by a Cossack and acquired by Laurent’s
patron the old soldier when he fought at the Battle of Balaclava in the
Crimean war when he took it from the dead body of the Russian cavalry
officer.
Lillya and Laurent forgot the brooch and left it on the ground. It was
later found by a pupil of the riding academy who turned it into Lost and
Found. Laurent wouldn’t claim it, so it was eventually donated to a church
benefit sale and bought by a sailor for his sweetheart before he was shipped
out to the Pacific. His beloved wore it every day as a good luck charm, and it
brought him home safe and sound. They married, had four children and lived
happily ever after, bequeathing the brooch to their eldest daughter. The
emerald did not bare misfortune, it acted as a lens to focus the intention of
the person who gave it. When given and received with love, it worked its
protecting magic but when it became an object of bitterness and resentment,
it bore a curse.
