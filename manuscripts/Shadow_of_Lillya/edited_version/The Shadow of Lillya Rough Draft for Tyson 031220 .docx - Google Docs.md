​The Shadow of Lillya​
​Audrey Berger Welz​

​Lillya shut her eyes and squeezed them tight. She imagined every muscle​
​and limb of her father’s favorite black stallion, and like she did as a young girl,​
​took off like Pegasus flying. The faster the horse went, the clearer her past became,​
​until it was as real as the struggles of her days. The planets parted, the stars​
​scattered, and a trail of her memories were left in the shadow.​

​Chapter 1​
​St. Petersburg, Russia ~ 1916​
​The sparkle from the jewels sewn into the gowns, draped around necks, and held in​
​place by bezels on the tiaras of the courtly ladies’ heads was almost blinding. Giant​
​crystal chandeliers swayed to the beat of the music, while six-foot-tall marble​
​vases filled with leaves of palm the size of an African elephant’s ear stood guard,​
​eavesdropping on every conversation.​
​A drunken frenzy inspired the orchestra to play faster and faster. The loose limbs​
​of the dancers on the ballroom floor looked like trees in a hurricane swaying up​
​and down gyrating in circles then shaking like dogs just pulled out of a frozen​
​pond, they wiggled until they collapsed from exhaustion.​
​Lillya caught a glimpse of a mysterious man with deep penetrating eyes. He was​
​standing quietly in the corner of the room observing the crowd. Their eyes barely​
​met but when they did for just a split second it was as if the fiery tip of an arrow​
​entered and left her body. Lillya let out an unexpected “Aah” Loud enough to draw​
​Anton’s attention but soft enough to hide it from anyone else. She had heard stories​
​of this man — a healer who had caught the attention of the Czar and Czarina.​

​A count poured a pitcher of drink down the front of a duchess’ finely stitched dress​
​and then without any inhibitions he started to lick it. Soon he was under her dress.​
​The duchess unfolded her fan as though she were blushing, with mock​
​embarrassment. The count popped his head out, quite content with himself, and​
​addressed the crowd, not noticing the man in the corner. “Do you know what secret​
​I found under there?”​
​The guests shouted back, “No!”​
​The count smiled, then winked and said, “The Empress doesn’t go to the hospital​
​to help the soldiers. She goes because the Czar no longer satisfies her. She’s taken​
​on a lover. I hear it’s a healer, but who? Who could it be?” He said again as if to​
​challenge the crowd. Then he grabbed the drunk duchess’ hand and started dancing​
​once again, knowing he had left one word on the lips of all in attendance, “Who?”​
​Lillya watched as the mysterious man in the corner left the room.​
​***​
​“We don’t have to stay, my dear,” Anton whispered in Lillya’s ear. “We’ve shown​
​ourselves. We can go now.”​
​Curious as to the goings-on at court, Lillya later discovered that this man yielded​
​more power than she had imagined. He would influence the future of her dear​
​Russia and be at the heart of many rumors.​
​3​

​Lillya Xenia Englehardt Vronsky was not quite as anxious as her husband to​
​depart. “Dance with me,” she said unexpectedly. “You know everyone loves to​
​watch you. You are the best dancer in this ballroom. Besides, we need to stay​
​informed, now more than ever,” she smiled through her teeth. She knew he knew​
​she was right, but she was also aware he had no stomach for such affairs. It pained​
​him to watch men and women he had once respected throw away their dignity as​
​easily as if it were an old scrap of food and simple to replace. However, Lillya​
​knew Anton would not refuse her.​
​Russia and St. Petersburg were fighting for their lives. “Millions of soldiers have​
​died,” Lillya thought to herself. “And all the upper class can think about is​
​overindulgence, intrigue and lies.”​
​As if he were able to read her thoughts, Anton whispered, “When they count their​
​money and jewels tomorrow, I hope they tuck some of it away. One of these days​
​the tables could turn and where will they all be then?” Anton did not say this to​
​scare her. He simply wanted her to have a more realistic idea of how the people​
​outside of their class felt. What was their level of aggravation and frustration and​
​underneath that, anger? He had a unique perspective, that of a common man who​
​had been brought into the folds of high society. With one eye he read the aristocrats​
​and with his other the people who came to his circus and the vendors from whom​
​he bought food and trinkets nearly every day on the street.​
​4​

​Anton was the heir of the most famous Russian family circus and came from a long​
​line of high-wire walkers like his father, Dimitri, who had owned the circus that​
​was situated near the Bolshoi. Every day of his life from boyhood to the day he​
​turned the circus over to his own son, Vladimir, Anton mixed and worked with the​
​people who filled his family’s bleachers. His circus made the crowds laugh and​
​scream. Yes, Anton felt certain he had a broader view of the temperature of the​
​world and such matters. He had married into the upper class but could still see the​
​world through the eyes of the people. With that in mind, years earlier, before the​
​1905 revolution and before he turned gray, Anton and Lillya passed on their​
​legacy, the Vronsky Family Circus, to their son who now lived in America with his​
​wife and four daughters. For this, Anton was glad, for he knew they were safe.​
​Now Anton only had to focus on his wife, and that was enough.​
​The palace, Lillya noted, had recently adopted a frugal existence. Still, the message​
​they were trying to send seemed to have little to no effect on the upper class, nor​
​did it dictate their actions. The aristocrats, simply put, did not want to see, feel, or​
​accept the rage and growing anger of the people just outside the palace doors, in​
​the streets where they shopped, or in front of their homes. Even though they could​
​see a dark cloud rising above them, they continued to spend enormous sums of​
​money frivolously while the population was feeling the pangs of war and hunger,​
​and this opulent ball was just one example.​
​5​

​As times got worse, Lillya and Anton moved onto her family’s estate with Lillya’s​
​father, Yuri Engelhart. It seemed to be the right thing to do and was a natural fit.​
​He loved good alcohol, fine fabrics, pastoral paintings, exotic food and most of all​
​fine horses. He valued athleticism and people who did the best they could at​
​whatever sparked their passion. He had enjoyed watching his grandson Vladimir​
​when he was a child, learning all the feats he would need to know to lead and run​
​the family’s circus that would be his destiny, although Yuri wondered what they​
​really thought about his estate and all that had come with it by birth. But Yuri​
​enjoyed the world that his daughter had become a part of, and on afternoons when​
​he had nothing else to do, he would visit the Vronsky Family Circus, sit in the​
​bleachers, and watch the dancing bears and elephants and tigers all learn new​
​tricks, and he was fascinated. “It takes so much more skill,” he said to Lillya, “It​
​would take me a lifetime of learning patience to do what they do. I so admire the​
​talents your son is inheriting.”​
​In later years, long after Lillya and Anton stitched a life together, to the extent that​
​Yuri had enjoyed Anton’s circus, equally, Anton surprised himself by the way he so​
​easily adjusted to a life of leisure living with Yuri.​
​<Date or reference to the revolution needed to place this is historical time. This​
​sounds like it follows the 1917 revolution.>​
​6​

​Still, sometimes of late, Lillya had to admit that it felt as if the world around her​
​was crumbling, especially in regard to her homeland Russia; the country she loved​
​with all her heart.​
​Russia was battling with itself both inside and out and it wasn’t long before news​
​began to trickle in about the arrests of friends; themselves wealthy aristocrats,​
​some, who just like Lillya and Anton, had attended the ball not even three months​
​past. The uncertainty of their future began to haunt her and she found herself​
​staying up late into the night trying to wash the nightmares away. She remembered​
​each one and could repeat them all at will with incredible detail and skill similar to​
​the concentration it took her when creating her own fine needlework. Fear ran up​
​and down her body just as it had the night before, and she witnessed herself​
​tripping over a small log and landing in the middle of a big mud puddle. She​
​couldn’t get up by herself. The mud was like glue and she couldn’t escape. She was​
​vulnerable and unable to protect herself. “Which army would eventually come to​
​get them?” she wondered. She found it almost impossible to come up for air and​
​she thought she would die. Then a man with a familiar demeanor came down from​
​heaven to visit her and he wrapped his arms around her and told her not to worry​
​because he would save her. Day to day, night by night it seemed as if she tried out​
​different dreams to see how they would fit just as someone else might try on an​
​overcoat. She would feel it and smell it and use different voices to better​
​7​

​understand it. Would it be the Reds or Whites that would ultimately come and take​
​them away? She tried to keep her immense fear to herself and would remind​
​herself that fear only breeds more fear. News continued to find its way to their​
​door, and none of it was good.​
​The protests and scuffles between the political factions became more violent.​
​Every couple of days it seemed someone they knew vanished, and soon Lillya and​
​Anton were forced to face the truth. “St. Petersburg has gotten too dangerous for​
​people like us,” Anton finally told his wife. “We can’t hold off any longer.”​
​Lillya was in agreement with her husband. She felt bad, for Anton was only guilty​
​by association, and as her husband, love bound him to protect her.  Many of Lillya​
​and Anton’s friends were being forced to clean toilets, while some had simply​
​disappeared. Had they been captured, or had they escaped?​
​Lillya’s family was not as high up the aristocratic ladder, but they were all​
​well-liked and they each had a special talent that could not be replicated. Her​
​father’s gift was to be good at nearly everything he tried, but most of all he was​
​kind and he was charming. Still, Lillya realized that had she not been married to​
​Anton she might have already fallen into one of those categories and none were​
​very appealing. “You’re right,” she said to Anton and her father over dinner. “I​
​understand, it’s time for us to go.”​
​8​

​The weeks before their departure, her father and Anton planned and plotted. “It’s​
​good that you could see so far ahead, Yuri,” Anton said after Yuri reviewed his idea​
​of sending Lillya and Anton off to their cousin Michael and the favors Michael​
​owed him.  “He’s a good man, but one needs a little more than goodness during​
​these times to get someone to risk their life.” So, it was decided and Lillya had her​
​own reasons to follow suit.  Besides her father, Anton loved her more than anyone​
​and both would give their own lives to save her, so she had no reason not to trust​
​their plan.​
​Until that day, though, Lillya decided to appreciate every minute and every​
​pleasure that she had been afforded during her life; besides, riding her favorite​
​stallion to try to take her mind off of what was about to happen seemed like a smart​
​thing to her.​
​“Am I grayer than I was last week?” she asked her husband. They had all seemed​
​to grow older in that short period of time, more than she had imagined possible. As​
​they came up with the details of their plan, it became clear her father would stay​
​behind.​
​***​
​“I insist! Our old workhorse, Sophie, is exactly the kind of horse I will need, and​
​she won’t attract attention. Sophie and Timur are my choices and Anton can choose​
​a horse to pull our cart.  That’s enough. Any more and we’ll have thieves outside​
​9​

​our campfire waiting for the fire to grow dim so they can jump in and take what is​
​ours.”​
​The day of their parting came like any other. The sun rose, they ate their breakfast​
​together, and joked as if they would be doing the same tomorrow. But as the hour​
​of their departure neared, their emotions began to take over.​
​Lillya heard her father searching through his favorite room. “Not this one.” And he​
​broke the bottle. She knew better than to join him at this moment. He had a right to​
​release his feelings in private. Lillya reflected on the many hours her father had​
​spent throughout the years categorizing, arranging and rearranging this room. She​
​wondered if her old father would be walking as well as he did for a man his age if​
​he had not had the determination each day to to walk up and down the stairs to his​
​cellar to dote on the many bottles that made him so happy.​
​Minutes later she heard her father express a very satisfied, “Yes.” She quickly​
​moved away from the door. She didn’t want her father to think she had been​
​listening.​
​“We’re going to have a little something before I send you off,” he said when he​
​climbed back up the stairs. “Can’t let you go without warming you up a bit first.​
​Tell that husband of yours to come inside.”​
​When Lillya and Anton entered her father’s study, he was opening an ungodly​
​expensive bottle of Massandra Sherry that had once been a part of the Czar’s​
​10​

​private wine collection. Uncorking it like the expert he was, he poured three​
​glasses. He refused to make a toast, for there would be no solemn goodbye, instead​
​he lit his pipe and sat back in his old leather chair to better enjoy the smell of his​
​tobacco. Lillya had enjoyed watching her father perform this ritual since she was a​
​little girl. Next would come a soft, high, gurgly sound, the sound of her father​
​imploring his tongue to fall into place and his lungs to pull in just the right amount​
​of air to kidnap the scent of the wine’s bouquet.​
​Without saying a word, they were all aware of the placement of the sun. They had​
​decided they would depart before sunset, the time of least recognition.​
​Anton went back outside to check on the horses. He wanted Lillya to have a few​
​moments alone with her father. They all knew that this was very likely the last time​
​they would see one another in this physical lifetime.​
​Lillya had passed on the stallion and her favorite mare. She told her solid​
​workhorses that they would soon be the ones leading the way. Lillya heard her​
​father and Anton approaching from the front door. She knew it was the front door​
​because of the peculiar sound it made. It reminded her of the racket of the cricket​
​chorus in the field nearby.​
​Over the many years she had lived in this home she had come to recognize the​
​creaks and squeaks of every wood plank in each room of the house and the​
​distinctive way each door sang to her when it opened and closed. It was as if they​
​11​

​had created and learned anew their own language. “It makes the house friendlier,”​
​she told her father when she was only a young woman.  Some nights she joked​
​with her father telling him that she had begun to understand what they said.​
​About to say something, she held her breath. She felt a strange sense of foreboding.​
​But why wouldn’t she? She was leaving the place that held so many memories​
​from her childhood until now. They knew their reality, their entire way of life, was​
​going to vanish. It seemed unfathomable. In a way, they felt detached even though​
​they found themselves right in the center of all that was happening. In their minds​
​they were simply players on the stage of life.​
​Lillya leaned in to give her father one last kiss but he touched her shoulder to stop​
​her.​
​“I have something to give you, Lillya.” Her father said. “I should have done this​
​years ago, but I didn’t have the courage. It’s wrapped in a small, ordinary maid’s​
​towel so if a thief sees it they’ll think it holds no value. Inside are answers to the​
​many questions I know still linger. Put it someplace safe and if you can, keep it to​
​yourself.”​
​Lillya lifted one corner of the package to see what was inside. It was her father’s​
​journal. “Some of the pages are soiled, but it’s all that you’ll need,” he told Lillya.​
​“Now go. Finish getting yourself ready. You are not a young girl anymore, and​
​don’t worry about your old papa. I’ve had a good life and more than any other​
​12​

​person, it was you who brought me joy, you and that son of yours. Oh, how I miss​
​him.”​
​Anton walked back in the house and her father kissed Anton on the cheek and​
​grasped both his hands.​
​“Take care of my daughter as you always have,” he said to Anton.  “Remember,​
​you are to head toward the Ural Mountain range then go to the town of Kungur. It​
​is near Perm.”​
​“Perm. That’s where Natasha is from,” Lillya reflected silently.​
​Her father continued. “You will go to​​the lower part​​of the town. On Kittarskaya​
​Street is the Uspenskaya Church. Your mother’s cousin​​Michael​​is friends with the​
​priest,” he said. Then he glanced at Lillya the same way he had when she was a​
​child to make certain she was listening. “He is expecting you. The priest and his​
​church have received large donations for this service,” he went on to say. “The​
​church has places where you both will be able to hide together, safely in plain​
​sight.” Yuri slowed his speech, dragging out each word, not wanting this​
​conversation to end. “ has many trustworthy friends. Besides, in doing this he is​
​paying back an old debt.”​
​“Thank you, Papa. I promise we won’t forget. I love you!”​
​Staying behind was surely a death sentence, but he had decided there was not a​
​better nor more fitting place for him to die. He had never needed such a big house​
​13​

​nor so much property. It had been passed down to him as all property got passed​
​down to the firstborn male. It was all he had ever known. And now he had a​
​lifetime of memories and was too old and formed in his habits to start anew. He​
​loved his estate, the wine and the horses and he had always taken good care of the​
​families who lived with them. There would be no goodbyes. Instead two short​
​French phrases rolled off his tongue. “​À​​prochaine​​fois​” and “​Je t'embrasse très​
​fort​.” Then he did his best to smile. However, that​​was the day everything changed.​
​Lillya could feel her father’s eyes on her back, but she did not dare turn around for​
​fear that all the courage she had gathered up to have the strength to go would​
​evaporate into dust and she would run back to him, wrap her arms around his neck​
​and never let go.​
​How would all of this conflict end? Where would this revolution of the soul go and​
​where would it take the people and the country she loved? How would they ever be​
​able to fix all that they had blindly broken? Was there any goodness left floating in​
​the sky tucked underneath a big fluffy cloud? Or a place on earth where peace and​
​truth reigned? Had kindness disappeared? What would happen to her father and​
​Anton and her son Vladimir? What would be left for the children and where would​
​they go? The Russia she knew had been fading away, breaking up bit by bit,​
​disappearing before their eyes, and in its place all that was left was confusion and​
​14​

​poverty, laced with violence and fear. Sadly, what she had hoped would only last​
​weeks turned into months and years.​

​Childhood Days- Before the storm ~1860​
​Chapter 2​
​“It’s mine,” Natasha said, and she grabbed the necklace right out of Lillya’s hand.​
​“You know that’s not true. It was a gift from the Duchess herself. That’s what my​
​grandmother told me.” Lillya’s grandmother was really a great-aunt who thought​
​her dead younger sister’s daughter would need a grandmother, and it was a role she​
​had been training for and thought she could fulfill.​
​Lillya didn’t see her grandmother often; she lived in Moscow and traveled to other​
​parts of Europe frequently with her husband, from whom she inherited her title and​
​royalty. Nonetheless, Lillya was sentimental about the old woman, more so than​
​most others in her life.​
​“It’s only because your mother died and me and the old one are your only true​
​friends.” For a second Natasha felt bad for saying something so hurtful, but Lillya​
​took Natasha’s guilt and used it against her and in this moment of weakness she​
​tackled Natasha and pinned her down on the floor. After a few minutes they both​
​got tired and Natasha gave up.​
​“Okay, here it is.” Laughing she handed Lillya the simple heart-shaped ruby​
​necklace. Remembering her place, she lifted Lillya’s long golden wavy hair and​
​16​

​spun it into a bun on the top of her head, then added a deep red rose from the​
​garden that was conveniently in a vase nearby to top off her masterpiece. Then she​
​clasped the lock closed and let the necklace fall down Lillya’s front where it rested​
​just above her chest.​
​“Now turn around so I can see how it shines almost as brightly as your eyes. But​
​it’s not nearly as beautiful as you,” said Natasha. Lillya just smiled. She was used​
​to these sorts of easy compliments from Natasha.​
​Another maid walked through the door. “Will you please prepare a bath for​
​Lillya?” Natasha asked. Then she watched and waited until the bathwater was​
​poured, the maid knowing that Natasha had almost full authority to ask for​
​whatever she liked when it came to Lillya. The maid delicately removed Lillya’s​
​clothes and helped her slip into the tub.​
​Lillya admired Natasha’s composure and self-assuredness. She never brought up​
​money or the fact that by social class she was far above Natasha’s station, for she​
​liked and respected her too much to do something so cruel. They had grown up​
​together, and Natasha was more like a sister than anything else. Lillya couldn’t​
​remember a time when she didn’t know Natasha. As far as she was concerned, they​
​had shared most everything since birth.  Still, as they grew older, their difference in​
​stature and how society would judge them would become more apparent, for​
​Natasha would remain forever the server and Lillya the receiver.​
​17​

​Sometimes as much as she loved Lillya, Natasha couldn’t stop herself from getting​
​fed up with her situation, and she would find herself becoming a bit manipulative.​
​Natasha would search for a way to turn the tables and on more than one occasion,​
​she almost had Lillya convinced that by being poor, Natasha was the wealthy one.​
​Like the beautiful summer day when Lillya’s father Yuri took Natasha​
​shopping—even though Natasha knew most everything that they would buy would​
​ultimately end up on Lillya, Natasha knew that Lillya would see it as Natashe​
​getting to spend more time with her father, garnering his attention. Being the same​
​size as Lillya worked for and against each of them depending upon their mood and​
​generosity of spirit. Recognizing their similarities, when Yuri wanted to buy​
​something special for Lillya and he wanted to pick it out himself, he would often​
​arrange for Natasha to have the day off. This way he wouldn’t have to interrupt​
​Lillya’s studies and Natasha got to spend an entire day by herself with Lillya’s​
​father. And if he bought Lillya a new blouse, he purchased a smart-looking scarf​
​for Natasha along with a lovely belt so they each got to show off something​
​special. But for Natasha, the best gift she received on her days spent with Yuri was​
​the silent permission he gave her to converse freely, show off her intelligence, wit​
​and humor, and every smile that Yuri gave her in return was more than enough​
​reward for her. If she had been rich, she would have been stuck at home like Lillya​
​18​

​with the tutor, memorizing her lessons instead of spending the day with the best​
​seamstress in all of St. Petersburg.​
​Natasha was beautiful like Lillya, and they shared a similar slant of the nose and a​
​distinct dimple on their chins. Neither girl could believe their luck to be so similar​
​in both spirit and looks. They were close in age and often pretended they were​
​twins. Natasha was skilled like Lillya, but in different ways. She had a​
​photographic memory and could remember everything Lillya had ever read to her,​
​every classic, every poem. She could recite what she had heard almost word for​
​word. She excelled in history and even learned to speak French just by sitting next​
​to Lillya during her lessons. French, the language of the aristocracy, slipped off her​
​tongue easier than it did her patron.​
​Natasha’s mother was a housekeeper at a nearby estate and they moved to St.​
​Petersburg from Perm when she was barely three. They never spoke of her father​
​and Natasha had come to the conclusion that she was better off that way. It allowed​
​her to design the father she wanted. Only she needed to believe it was true, and she​
​could keep him to herself and continue living her life, and nobody bothered her or​
​disagreed.​
​Natasha visited her mother every Sunday. A woman would come from the estate​
​where her mother worked and would dress her in the clothes Yuri’s personal maid​
​had laid out for her, but when she arrived where her mother worked no matter how​
​19​

​beautifully or elegantly she had been dressed she would be sent to the back door​
​where her mother and the other help entered and where her mother would greet her​
​with a big smile. She had been instructed many years prior to never enter through​
​the house from the main entrance.​
​Natasha loved her mother, but over time Sunday became her least favorite day of​
​the week. But still it gave her the one thing she knew Lillya wanted and yearned​
​for but did not have; a mother.​
​Natasha worshipped Lillya and taking care of Lillya and being her friend became​
​her “raison d’​ê​tre.” And her rewards came in the form​​of pretty clothes, good​
​books and education, very unusual for anyone of her class. Most of the time she​
​felt privileged to have been given such an important job. It made her feel a step​
​above the other maids, and she was.​
​Lillya’s father Yuri was a tall handsome man who stood out from across a room.​
​However, what made him special to Natasha was his ability to see what was special​
​about her, and the way he quietly encouraged her by allowing Natasha to sit in on​
​Lillya’s tutoring sessions and make certain she was not disturbed. Lillya could​
​have objected, but she enjoyed the company and later she had someone to discuss​
​that day’s lesson with who could remember it almost word for word.​
​***​
​20​

​Lillya stood up in the tub. The maid was waiting with a towel to dry Lillya off and​
​prepare her for evening’s supper. She undid her bun, took out the rose Natasha had​
​put in her hair and shook her long mane. It was almost as thick as a horse’s tail.​
​Drops of water splattered across the room, leaving pools of water on the floor.​
​Petra and Dimitri Vronsky from the famous Vronsky Family Circus were coming​
​to their home to show her father a young mare they thought would be good for​
​breeding. “They’ll be staying for supper,” her father had announced earlier.​
​Lillya had never been to the circus and she was curious. She had been brought up​
​to believe that you only went to the circus if you had been invited to watch the​
​performers at the palace of the Czar. It was below them, but recently her father had​
​changed his mind. As he got to know Dimitri better, he found himself growing​
​fonder of the man who was a master on the tightrope and a wizard when it came to​
​horses. Dimitri was well educated and very clever, besides being strong and brave.​
​All qualities Yuri admired, and he enjoyed Dimitri’s dry wit and sense of humor.​
​“The man says what he thinks and doesn’t stop himself from expressing what he​
​really feels. Most men are afraid of what other men might think, and this makes​
​him courageous in my eyes.”​
​Lillya started talking excitedly while the maid was drying her off. “Papa says when​
​Mr. Vronsky touches a horse something magical happens. He knows which ones to​
​choose. It’s as if they speak to him,” she told Natasha.​
​21​

​Natasha was fumbling through Lillya’s drawers.​
​“What are you looking for?” she asked.​
​“Got it!” and Natasha pulled out a simple gold necklace to complement Lillya’s​
​ruby, along with a matching bracelet.​
​“Now that’s perfect,” she said, feeling quite satisfied with herself. “They’ll be here​
​within the hour, we must hurry.”​
​A blue-green gown with gold threads was waiting on Lillya’s bed, but first they​
​had to fix her hair. “If you move any slower, they’ll find someone to replace me​
​and then what would you do?” Natasha teasingly barked.​
​“Papa would never replace you. I couldn’t live without your company,” Lillya​
​replied. “I’d have to go on a hunger strike.”​
​Natasha smiled because she knew Lillya was telling the truth.​
​Looking out the window Lillya saw the Vronskys coming up to the house from the​
​stables. “Papa’s got a smile on his face. He must have liked what he saw. Looks​
​like he decided she’s the one.”​
​Lillya quickly walked down the stairs into the parlor where the Vronskys and her​
​father had just been poured drinks and were being served caviar by the help. Her​
​father seemed to be quite taken by the couple.  He rarely grinned and only showed​
​his poker face to strangers, but on this occasion he could barely fit all the happiness​
​he felt inside of himself.​
​22​

​Petra’s petite figure was dressed in a bold royal blue and her dark shiny hair;​
​blended with streaks of amber, yellow, and gold, was pulled back and wrapped into​
​a perfect twist. Her smile was bright and warm and would disarm any soldier she​
​came in contact with. Yes, any man determined to do battle with her would surely​
​lose and fall to her feet.​
​Petra had a relaxed and natural way about her and she did not notice her effect on​
​men. She would casually throw her head back to get her hair out of her eyes and​
​laugh as if she were the only one in the room. She clearly loved her life and her​
​husband most of all.​
​***​
​“My daughter Lillya is the horsewoman of our family and she is going to love your​
​horse!​
​“Lillya, this is Mr. and Mrs. Vronsky from the famed Vronsky Family Circus,”​
​Yuri said.​
​“Your father has told us much about you,” Mr. Vronsky interjected.​
​Lillya for a moment became speechless as her father continued to brag about her​
​with a great sense of pride.” He says you can already ride standing up. That’s a​
​great accomplishment and says much about your character.”​
​23​

​“I find if one is balanced and is not afraid and speaks kindly to a horse she knows​
​quite well, that most anything is possible,” Lillya shyly replied. “That is with​
​practice, of course.”​
​“I must agree,” Petra Vronsky replied. “I have seen tricks on horses that would​
​stump a magician.” Lillya instantly liked her. She found it easy to talk with Petra​
​and imagined they had much in common and would have been friends in another​
​lifetime.​
​A butler called them in for supper. Lillya caught a glimpse of Natasha at the top of​
​the stairs and was happy she was listening in. She wished that she could call​
​Natasha down to join them, but they both knew their place. She would have to​
​share the evening with her later.​
​Biting into a Cornish hen, she admired their cook’s ability to add just the right​
​amount of paprika on top of it and dole out to each person a perfect serving size of​
​rosemary potatoes. Lillya soon forgot about Natasha, savoring each bite and morsel​
​of food, as much as the conversation.​
​She let her father take the lead, remembering they had company, for it might have​
​sounded rude for her to ask the questions she wanted to know the answers to​
​immediately. Finally, they got around to the subject Lillya was most interested in​
​hearing about—the circus. She was besotted by a story Dimitri told about their​
​tigers Midnight and Satin. They were recently given to the Vronskys by a Prince​
​24​

​from India after he saw them perform for the Czar and his children on the lawn of​
​the Winter Palace. Dimitri said, “I was rehearsing one afternoon when all of a​
​sudden I heard a tremendous amount of commotion. I stopped to see what was​
​going on. When I went out front there were five royal carriages. The one in the​
​middle had the names Midnight and Satin painted on both sides in beautiful​
​colorful calligraphy. I stood there dumbfounded. By now Petra was outside next to​
​me.”​
​“Yes,” Petra agreed.​
​“Holding Petra’s hand,” Dimitri continued, “I inched in close to the carriage. A​
​man in formal Indian dress handed me a letter and said, ‘This is a gift from the​
​prince. You must have made quite an impression!’ Inside the gilded cage were two​
​tiger kittens, playing with a big ball of yarn. The representative continued to say​
​that they had been abandoned on the prince’s estate and that the prince himself had​
​personally nursed them back to health. So, what was I to do,” Dimitri asked, “but​
​to humbly accept them?”​
​“I used to go inside their cage and play with them until they got too big,” Petra​
​said. Lillya’s ears perked up even more when Petra mentioned they had a son who​
​walked the high wire and was also a notable horseman. She got chills just thinking​
​of anyone walking across a wire fifty feet up in the air, for only Natasha knew that​
​Lillya was afraid of heights unless there was something solid between her and the​
​25​

​ground. A horse was solid, so she had no problem standing up on the back of a​
​galloping roisenback. “Anyone can do that, but to walk a wire, why that is​
​magnificent.” Petra could tell Lillya was mesmerized by the glint she saw in her​
​eyes; a glint similar to the one in her own eyes when she first saw Dimitri perform​
​his act. Neither Lillya nor Yuri could hide their fascination.​
​Later that night, Lillya shared the events of the evening with Natasha, and did not​
​fail to say, “Oh, and did I tell you, his mother mentioned they have a son who​
​walks the high wire? I wonder why they made no offer of an introduction. They​
​didn’t even tell me his name. They simply said he was talented and had a playful​
​sort of personality.  They should know that I’m old enough to meet their son.”​
​Lillya went on. “Thank goodness for Papa, though. By the end of the evening he​
​decided to put his stallion with their mare. Then he promised the Vronskys that we​
​would attend their circus sometime soon.”​
​“After all, our horses are going to bring our families together,” Lillya’s father said​
​to the Vronskys as they were leaving.​
​Lillya’s father had no idea how true his words would become.​
​26​

​New Chapter <After the 1917 Revolution>​
​Keeping a secret is much harder to do when your audience is already mistrusting.​
​No one seemed to tell the truth. The trick was to be able to sense true from the​
​false and learn to interpret an ever-changing code. The White Army was made up​
​mostly of Russia’s armed forces, members of the upper classes, and soldiers from​
​other nations. They didn’t like one another, and they certainly weren’t unified. At​
​least that is what Anton told Lillya. Then the Reds had Trotsky, Lenin, and Stalin,​
​who were in competition for ultimate rule and would trip one another up any​
​chance they got, of course for the good of the cause. But then again, Lillya thought,​
​“Even my father was not completely truthful until he handed me his journal. Or​
​one could say he told the truth with great omissions.” This leather-bound book​
​would speak more intimately to Lillya in her father’s voice than he had his whole​
​life. The flames drew her into herself and got her thinking of the large townhouse​
​27​

​where she and Anton had lived when Vladimir was still young. She reminisced​
​about its gigantic fireplace and she wondered if those striking flames from so many​
​years prior were trying to tell her something and she hadn’t been listening. Then a​
​spark from the fire made a loud crackling sound and shook her back to the present.​
​In the distance, she could hear horses galloping and she wondered if they were​
​White or Red, or perhaps Czechs? They were fighting a world war on the Russian​
​front, but soon their army found themselves intertwined in a civil war as well.​
​Her ears followed the sound of the riders while her mind ran in circles until​
​eventually, she landed where she began. “Maybe they are just like us; people on the​
​run and hiding?” Still, she held her breath until they passed.​
​The cruelty of both sides had become well known. Lillya knew that their lives​
​could easily fall into the whims of a handful of soldiers and their fate would be​
​decided by what kind of night or day these soldiers had had. On a good day, they​
​might only take your food and horses. On a bad day, they would also shoot you and​
​not think twice.​
​Lillya thought about the journal her father had given to her. She was anxious to​
​read it. She was having a hard time falling asleep. The abandoned cabin they were​
​in was cold and dark. Still, she and Anton were grateful for the cover from the​
​wind. Lillya watched Anton’s stomach rising up and down and every once in a​
​while he would make a funny little squeaking sound through his nostrils. Trying​
​28​

​not to make any noise while making sure he was asleep, she put his handkerchief​
​lightly over his nose to lessen the sound and quietly slipped her thumb and her​
​index finger into the bag that carried her belongings, now including her father’s​
​journal, wanting to be able to read even just a little corner of truth before she said​
​her nightly prayers, and said goodnight to her parents, husband, her loved ones in​
​America.  Then she would set her mind and point it to a happy place so that when​
​she awoke the following day she could start it without any discoloration from the​
​day before .​
​”Just a few words and I’ll put you right back,” she toyed with herself and the​
​journal as if she were making a bargain with God. Anton’s snoring became much​
​louder and deeper even though he was a light sleeper. She didn’t want to risk​
​waking him, nor did she want him to catch her reading a journal he knew nothing​
​about. Her father had asked her to keep it to herself and that’s what she intended to​
​do to the best of her ability. But Lillya soon came to realize that when one finds​
​themselves in the middle of a revolution with no end in sight, they should avoid​
​making promises, for they are not easy to keep.​
​LiIllya could see Anton’s legs becoming restless and knew that soon he would​
​open his eyes. She got shivers up and down her spine. But she wasn’t certain if this​
​29​

​chill was because she felt embarrassment and guilt that she would be discovered​
​reading a book of secrets that for the time-being her father had asked remain​
​between just the two of them, or had she simply gotten a chill from sleeping in a​
​drafty old cottage. Either way for now she would hold her father’s secrets to​
​herself. She wrapped his journal quickly back into the maid’s towel and threw it in​
​her satchel.​
​Anton rubbed his hands over his eyes. Then he shook his right leg several times​
​and next his left, making a sudden jerky motion as if he had not been sleeping at all​
​and then sat up.​
​“What are you doing, my dear?” He said in a clear authoritative voice, “Tomorrow​
​is a big day. You’re going to need your sleep.” Noticing Lillya was shivering, he​
​came over with a  blanket and gently laid it on top of her, making sure he had​
​covered her feet then he bent down and gave her a kiss to remind her he was​
​watching over her.​
​“Thank you, my sweet,” she replied and closed her eyes. “The journal will be there​
​in the morning,” she whispered to herself. Then nodding to Anton, she said.​
​“Perhaps if I keep my eyes closed and think sweet thoughts I will sleep.” But​
​before she knew it, small rays of sunlight were finding their way into the cabin and​
​they were planning their day.​
​30​

​The horses she had heard earlier were now off in the distance frightening someone​
​else. Lillya took a deep breath and let out a sigh of relief. Her husband had done​
​what he could the evening before to keep her warm and protect her from the​
​unknown danger lurking in the woods.​
​Anton handed her a large cup of tea to help her greet the morning and when he was​
​through, he covered the fire with a large pot to suffocate the flame.​
​“If we hurry, my dear, I believe we can reach Kungur before sunset.” But by the​
​look on her face she let him know he was going to have to be more enticing and​
​seductive than that to get her to give up her blanket for the cold and unknown.​
​“I can almost smell the faint taste of leather off in the distance.” Lillya could smell​
​what her husband was talking about but decided it could only smell that delicious​
​to someone who was making money from it. He added, as if he were describing a​
​freshly frosted cake, “That is what has made Kungur so famous. It’s on the tip of​
​my nose. Can you smell it?” he asked Lillya, trying to engage her senses. Anton​
​repeated his words once more, hoping this time like a happy fisherman he would​
​see his catch at the end of his rod when he lifted it out of the water. “Maybe​
​Kungur will satisfy my craving.”​
​“Yes,” Lillya responded, “Kungur.” Then she paused for several seconds, put on a​
​grin that almost matched his, “Isn’t that the last stop before nowhere?”  Lillya and​
​Anton both burst out in laughter.​
​31​

​“I guess it’s not so bad. At least we’ll be on the west side of the mountain range.​
​Think of our Czar and his family; they’re on the Eastern side in Siberia with five​
​million square miles of nothing but isolation, ice, and snow,” Anton went on now​
​that he knew he had her attention.​
​“We should be grateful. We’ll be near Perm where there is a decent Opera, and I​
​hear they grow watermelon in the summer,” Lillya said in a voice that could almost​
​pass as joyful, while under her breath she was pondering the thought, “Could​
​Natasha be there?”​
​“Perm Provence is large,” Anton continued. “Remember we will be at the mercy of​
​others. This is not a vacation, Lillya.”​
​Lillya had never been to Siberia, still all Russians had heard stories of the place​
​and found ways to romanticize what it took to survive the rough life with its many​
​unique qualities, but most shuddered with fear at the thought of being forced to live​
​there. Some compared it to a batch of stew where a little of everything was thrown​
​in until it became something new. European prisoners of war mixed with native​
​Aboriginal tribesmen and they sometimes spiced the pot by throwing in a Russian​
​Jew or political exile. Then there was the Trans-Siberian Railway; workers from​
​around the world populated that path for over 15 years while they built it.​
​For a few minutes Lillya had given herself permission to daydream.  Every once in​
​a while as Anton spoke, she caught a glimpse of her old self. The teenage girl who​
​32​

​galloped through the woods like a streak of lightning while standing upright on the​
​back of her father’s favorite stallion.​
​Lillya wondered where it would one day all lead. She found herself and Anton​
​getting more and more entangled in this mess and she became that much more​
​determined to find a way out. “I will see my son and his wife and children before I​
​leave this earth behind. I will see the equestrian Ann Marie Heart and maybe her​
​children, too. I will have grand conversations with our scholar Lucky, watch Spade​
​carry on the family tradition and walk the high wire, and Diamond will sparkle,​
​I’m sure, just as she does in the photographs Vladimir and Belle sent me. She must​
​be a star in her own right by now. Yes, Lillya became determined that she would​
​someday see her granddaughters and get to know Bella, Vladimir’s wife.​
​Each night Lillya would prop herself up after Anton fell asleep once she had​
​discovered the spot that gave her the best light. Then she would read in secrecy​
​until her eyes hurt and looked like small slits.  Eventually the chill from being​
​outside would override her curiosity. However, on one such occasion, just as she​
​was about to close the journal, the name Michael popped out.  Lillya could barely​
​contain herself.  What would she find, she wondered?​
​33​

​34​

​New chapter – Lillya’s childhood​
​Born the daughter of a maid, Natasha couldn’t help but feel that she had been​
​misplaced. Her quick wit was apparent to anyone who met her, and it seemed​
​impossible for her to keep it entirely to herself. She recognized how lucky she was​
​to have been placed in Yuri’s household on this beautiful estate and to have become​
​Lillya’s best friend.​
​Lillya’s father Yuri was very generous, and on some deep level, Lillya saw that he​
​felt bad for Natasha and his compassion made her love him more. He left books​
​under her pillow for her to read. Each time Natasha found a new book she would​
​devour it, staying up late at night until her eyes got weary and she could no longer​
​lift her head.​
​Thinking about her station in life only got her depressed so she focused on other​
​things, like pleasing Lillya and Yuri.​
​Lillya and Natasha became inseparable and Natasha hoped it would never end.​
​Lillya, not one to look too far down the road, did not see that life would eventually​
​take them down different paths. Though Lillya’s father Yuri knew that day would​
​come, in the meantime he believed he was doing something good.  He gave​
​Natasha a good home where she could be educated, challenged, and cared for, and​
​he gave his daughter a best friend and confidant, whom she could love and trust.​
​35​

​***​
​Lillya’s mother had been ill as long as Lillya could remember, though once in a​
​while the doctors would let her come home. When they did, everyone would be on​
​pins and needles waiting for the moment the symptoms of her anxiety would begin​
​again. She would shake and sweat just a little bit and that would last for several​
​days. The nurses would wipe her brow and try to keep her comfortable and calm​
​her down with smelling salts and herbs. By the fourth night they would wrap her​
​tightly in a blanket to keep her arms pinned so she couldn’t hurt herself.​
​Lillya would toss and turn on those nights. She would sing herself to sleep while​
​trying to focus on songs that made her happy, ones with happy lyrics and melodies​
​that uplifted her. She prayed that her power of thought could be strong enough to​
​override her mother’s demons and bring about a happy ending.​
​Both girls knew what would happen next. Natasha would pull her covers down and​
​quietly make her way to Lillya’s bed, Lillya would open her blanket and let​
​Natasha into her bed in the morning they would awake with their arms wrapped​
​around each other.​
​Lillya’s mother Angelina wouldn’t shout or cry, even though sometimes they​
​wrapped her so tightly she could barely breathe. Where she was going would be​
​more comfortable for her and bring her one step closer to her life’s purpose; to be​
​God’s messenger as was written in her name, but she kept on wondering, of what?​
​36​

​In the middle of the night, Natasha and Lillya would hear the carriage wheels​
​approaching, the clop, clop of the horses’ hoofs as they got nearer. It was​
​impossible to interpret the commotion that was taking place, the low humming​
​mumbles of her father and the doctors. A groggy reply in response from her​
​mother, who earlier had been given something they called opium.  All Natasha and​
​Lillya knew was that it was strong and made her mother agreeable and sleepy.​
​Angelina’s doctor, speaking through his mustache and beard, was discussing​
​something with the other doctors and Lillya’s father while the rest of the crowd,​
​that included secretly Lillya and Natasha, waited for the verdict as if each hair on​
​his mustache represented an opera fan and everyone in the theater would be silent​
​waiting to hear what the verdict would be, “Stay” or “Go,” but her father already​
​knew and so did Lillya and Natasha. They would be taking her to the spa in Odessa​
​where she could rest and hopefully get better and one day return to the family for​
​good.​
​The entire process usually only took five or six weeks. At first everything would be​
​wonderful, and Lillya would get very excited and almost believe she might have a​
​mother. But even by the age of five or six, the more it happened—and it did, again​
​and again, Lillya began to recognize the signs. She could read her mother’s body​
​language.​
​37​

​The headaches would start, then she would join the family only for lunch, then she​
​would lock herself in her room for the rest of the day. Soon she wouldn’t venture​
​out of her bedroom at all, nor receive any visitors, including Lillya. Then, almost​
​like clockwork, the sweating and shaking would begin and the following day​
​Natasha would hand Lillya a note when she opened her eyes for the day ahead, but​
​the flowers next to her bed told Lillya all that the note would say. Natasha stood​
​ready with Lillya’s robe and slippers and together they would enter her mother’s​
​bedroom. The bed would be made as if no one had ever been there, and Lillya​
​would defend her mother’s actions by repeating to Natasha what she had heard all​
​her life: her mother had a special job and she was off being a messenger for God,​
​and then Lillya, like her mother, would think, for what? For whom?​
​Lillya would ask her Grandmama, when they were alone, where her mother had​
​really gone. Grandmama would say, “She’s with the doctors back at the hospital​
​trying to get better for you.” At least that was a partial truth. But then one morning​
​her Grandmama came to their house dressed head to toe in black. Lillya did not​
​have to ask. Her father, not grasping Lillya’s comprehension of the situation, told​
​her that her mother had decided to visit God during the night and she found it so​
​peaceful and delightful that she missed the one train back home. Flowers came and​
​filled the house and Lillya laid some on her mother’s grave as Lillya stood bravely​
​next to her father with Natasha holding her hand. Later her Grandmama handed her​
​38​

​a note, saying “I found this in your mother’s room.” It simply said, “Tell my​
​daughter to have a good life. We will see each other again when the angels call for​
​her many years from now.” Years later Lillya waited for her mother in the dark, but​
​she never came.​
​39​

​New Chapter ~ 1918​
​“Perm Provence is large,” Anton recited. “Remember we will be at the mercy of​
​others. This is not a vacation.”​
​Lillya had never been to Siberia, but all Russians had heard stories of the place and​
​at times found ways to romanticize the rough life it took to survive with its unique​
​qualities, but mostly they shuddered with fear at the thought of being forced to live​
​there. Some had compared it to a batch of stew where a little of everything was​
​thrown in until it became something new. European prisoners of war mixed with​
​native Aboriginal tribesmen and they sometimes spiced the pot by throwing in a​
​Russian Jew or political exile. Then there was the Trans-Siberian Railway; workers​
​from around the world populated that path for over 15 years while they built it.​
​For a few minutes Lillya had given herself permission to daydream.  Every once in​
​awhile, as Anton spoke, she caught a glimpse of her old self. The teenage girl who​
​galloped through the woods like a streak of lightning while standing upright on the​
​back of her father’s favorite stallion.​
​She and Anton had been on edge long before they had left Petrograd, a name she​
​couldn’t get used to, the new name of her beloved St. Petersburg. She had forgotten​
​what it was like to have no reason to hide.  And, oh, how Anton hated being the​
​one assigned to hold her kite string.​
​***​
​40​

​Anton had gathered a large stick at the beginning of their journey and he marked it​
​each morning to keep track of the days. Without it, they would have gotten lost.​
​“Just one more long, grueling day,” Anton thought as he marked the twig for what​
​he hoped would be the last time. “If I’m right, by day’s end we will finally be able​
​to give that wife of mine a rest.” Having no one to talk with he had become quite​
​conversant with himself and the horses he tended to as well.​
​Lillya rarely complained.  Still, she had to admit to herself that she was looking​
​forward to sleeping in the same place, the same bed for more than one or two​
​nights and she would be happy to let her guard down a bit wherever it was that​
​they settled when they finally settled and to wherever it was the stars and destiny​
​led them. Then she gave one giant yawn, said a quick prayer, and got down to the​
​business of the day. Soon, she would be able to spend hours tucked away with her​
​father’s journal, unraveling secrets she was positive she would find. Just thinking​
​about it made her feel guilty.​
​Remembering seeing the name Michael, a chill ran up and down her spine. He was​
​taking a big risk by hiding them. Maybe her father Yuri blackmailed him or​
​perhaps Michael was indebted to return a big favor? All in due time, she thought,​
​smiling at Anton. Enough of their life had been torn apart. She wasn’t so certain​
​that her father had done her a favor by giving her his journal.​
​41​

​Anton recognized that smile in Lillya’s eyes, however he knew it was safe not to​
​ask her what it meant.​
​For a while she had forgotten how tired her feet and legs had become, not to​
​mention her swollen ankles.  She thought about her son Vladimir and his family.​
​“Does he look like his father? Do any of his girls resemble me perhaps in spirit?”​
​Lillya missed her son horribly and she cursed her country and all of its stupid​
​political factions for the reasons he lived so far away and for the pain that she felt​
​from never having held any of her granddaughters, but Anton had been needed in​
​the early years by his parents and of course Lillya had her father Yuri. She recited​
​the names of Vladimir’s children. “Let’s see, Ann Marie Heart, Spade, Diamond​
​Claire, and Lucia Akinsya Club. The last child was named after herself, as her full​
​name was Lillya Akinsya Engelhardt. ‘Akinsya’ had come from Lillya’s​
​great-grandmother, and she liked thinking there was an old Russian name that she​
​wore, too, floating around in that young country, the United States.​
​They had taken a short stop so Lillya could stretch. “If all goes well, tonight we’ll​
​be sleeping in Kungur.” Anton repeated once more. Then with hopeful eyes he​
​handed Lillya the reins of the sturdy workhorse she had ridden all of these months.​
​She was a far cry from her father’s stallion. She could see a small supply of​
​hopefulness in Anton’s eyes. Things were about to change. “If we are lucky, we​
​will arrive around dusk.”​
​42​

​Lillya smiled at Anton. She was thinking of her cousin Michael. She met him once​
​as a child and he had left quite an impression on her like a map in her memory. She​
​could only have been four or five because her mother was still alive. They had a​
​simple lunch together and he did not stay long after the meal. She remembered that​
​day clearly because Natasha had sat next to her and her father Yuri had put the​
​guest of honor between Natasha and Lillya’s mother.​
​Lillya remembered Michael was very distinguished looking with salt and pepper​
​hair and he had a mustache that he waxed and wore turned up. He seemed serious,​
​but then he’d tell a joke but no one laughed harder than him, and his smile would​
​suddenly grow twice as big. Then he would cough as if he were choking on his​
​own joke and laugh as if it was too big for even him. As a young girl she found​
​him very mysterious. She caught her father sometimes whispering his name. He​
​was her mother’s favorite cousin and therefore there was an air of myth that​
​surrounded him for no other reason.​
​“He’s going to be very old,” she said to Anton as he reset the bridle on her horse. It​
​had somehow gotten twisted along with her thoughts. Then suddenly a horrified​
​look covered her face. “Think of the shock he’ll have when he sees me!”  Up until​
​that moment she had forgotten about how much older she had become, too. But​
​then she remembered that all her cousin Michael would have to do would be to​
​43​

​look at her jaw and the small dimple in the middle of her chin and her painterly​
​nose with the perfect slant. “Some things don’t change,” she smiled.​
​She wore the family crest just like every other proud Englehardt. Yes, her cousin​
​would believe she was who she claimed to be. He’d be able to see it in her face.​
​She wore it as clearly as the statue of David rested his chin on his hand​
​contemplating the woes of the world.​
​44​

​New Chapter - Childhood​
​Her arms stretched out wide, the wind on her face, she spoke softly to her horse,​
​Pluto Gaetano, a gift from the Czar, her cheeks blushed bright red. She couldn’t​
​contain her excitement and covered her mouth with her hand to block the sound.​
​She howled to the chipmunks, rabbits, squirrels and all the animals of the forest.​
​Lillya had grown tired of being so secretive. She wanted the world to know what​
​they had accomplished. Her horse prepared himself. He knew what was coming​
​and he made an effort to keep an even, steady pace. He imitated her breath as if​
​they were a part of one another. Then she stood upright on Nicholas, her horse's,​
​back, and counted to eight, nine, ten. When she reached ten, she came back down​
​again. Rocking steadily forward, she was grinning from ear to ear.​
​“Good boy,” she said to the horse as she released the pressure in her knees. They​
​came to a slow steady trot, then she nestled her head into his neck, feeling all of his​
​muscles. “I'm so proud of you Nikki!  I have an apple in my pocket. I brought it​
​especially for you.” Then she gave him a hug.​
​Lilly began humming to herself. She liked to hum. She liked the way it felt. The​
​vibrations massaged her insides which got a little jumbled up between her​
​equestrian tricks and her feelings.​
​45​

​****​
​Lillya excelled above all the other girls her age in her ability to ride horses, but she​
​had one thing that she kept as a secret that was an embarrassment to her. She had a​
​single large mole in the middle of her back that was shaped like a heart.  Lillya felt​
​as if she had been marked when it came to love, but she didn’t know for what or​
​why. When she was a child, she and Natasha would try to rub the mole away. But​
​as she grew older, she had to come to terms with the fact it wasn’t going away.​
​“Yes, God has a plan for me,” she would say to Natasha, the only person who​
​knew. “This way he will know for certain how to find me when he is ready and be​
​certain I was the one.”​
​Lillya never met anyone besides Natasha who could replicate her own spirit.​
​Natasha was proud and pleased, but it was hard for Natasha, being so smart, to be​
​stuck in a lower station in life where nothing was expected of her. She could play​
​the piano and speak French, but no one wanted to hear what she could do besides​
​Lillya.​
​To allay her frustration with people not treating others well or wanting to​
​understand their own God-given gifts, Lillya rode every day. It was the only way in​
​which she filled her spirit after her mother passed away. She took out one of her​
​father’s horses and she rode him hard. Day by day she honed her talent. By age​

​twelve she had earned a reputation as a daring horsewoman. Her father had to close​
​his eyes when his young daughter practiced gymnastics on her horse behind him.​
​Natasha, too, had some questions left unanswered. Like, “Who is my father and​
​why was my beautiful, wonderful mother born into the station of a servant?” Deep​
​questions for young girls with the world in front of them.​
​Natasha tried not to think too much about the future. She believed she was living​
​her best life now, and Lillya was unwilling to admit that eventually they would be​
​forced by society to go their separate ways and develop separate lives.​

​New Chapter ~ 1918​
​Sleeping in abandoned shacks along the way to Kungur, Lillya dreamed of​
​spending an afternoon in a comfortable chair next to a window. Basking in the​
​indulgence of not having to travel, she imagined what it would be like to have her​
​body clean again and not have to find a river to jump in. They all had known that​
​they would travel during the summer, for the winter in Kungur would be the​
​coldest weather she had ever known. She laughed at the thought of all the pretty​
​dresses she had left behind, and wondered about Alexi, her dressmaker, who was​
​now probably sewing buttons on officers’ uniforms from whichever army had​
​grabbed him first. There wasn’t much in the way of choices these days. Life sort of​
​happened to everyone and we all had to find some way to wade through the muck​
​and sludge that slowed us down or took us to someplace we never would have​
​chosen to go. But our feet made us stay, they were like quicksand in dirt, and they​
​were forced to accept these unfamiliar boundaries. However, for Lillya, Kungur​
​actually sounded exciting, for she was tired of living in fear and wanted to feel as if​
​she had some control over her life and her destiny. She wished she could express​
​all her thoughts to Anton, but he was already frightened for her and if she did, she​
​was afraid they might scare him even more.​
​48​

​Being a noble man, Anton set very high expectations for himself and he would not​
​budge or lower them to make them easier. Sometimes Lillya would tease him about​
​his moral code, but deep down inside there was no one she would trust more with​
​her life if she had to put it in someone else’s hands. She knew he felt a huge​
​commitment to protect her, even sometimes from herself.​​(insert example)​​Now,​
​once too often, he would find himself pulling the kite string again and again.​
​“I understand that there is no time for pleasure today,” Lillya said to Anton as she​
​bent down to pick a poppy from a field close by. The rain and unusually warm​
​weather had sent everything to distract her. A golden summer breeze was working​
​its way in and would push her all the way to Kungur, she thought. “Let the wind​
​blow me and all our baggage away,” she said teasingly to Anton. “Blow me into​
​the unknown,” she continued. She could feel the string in Anton’s hand yanking​
​her back to the ground. “If only one of my father’s stallions could magically​
​appear, even for ten minutes, but I can’t afford to think like that, still sometimes I​
​can’t help myself.” Lillya quieted down. She couldn’t blame Anton for their​
​predicament, so she continued urging the workhorse forward, kicking the dirt and​
​muck aside, learning to appreciate the poppies from afar. To pass the time she​
​imagined a little house in Kungur that she would decorate and call home. The first​
​thing she saw was a large stone fireplace that rivaled the one in their townhouse in​
​St. Petersburg, but that was long ago and she knew her thought was too big. But​
​49​

​most of all, this little house in Kungur would be a place where she did not have to​
​worry. “If times weren’t so bad we’d still be at my father’s estate. But for now, I​
​need to reconcile that I can be happy with a little hint of sunlight caressing my face​
​and not feel the need to run every time a horse approached.” Her nose picked up a​
​foul scent, she realized it was herself. She was certain she was wretched by now​
​and Anton was too kind. Lillya smiled as thoughts ran through her head, scattering​
​like children on a playground. “Maybe our scents’ blended with each other’s until​
​now we don’t know whose is whose.”​
​“Lillya, where have you been?” Anton asked, knowing quite well the answer. “We​
​need to stay very alert today and not lose sight of one another even for a minute. I​
​know it’s very hard and not in your nature, darling, but today you must listen to my​
​commands. I promised your father I would get you to Kungur and in safe​
​condition. And I’m not about to prove myself wrong. So, I’ll need your help.”​
​“Don’t worry, my dear,” Lillya said with a wink. “Don’t you know I always listen​
​to you?”​
​Anton started to laugh with his deep belly laugh that put a smile on her face.​
​“Okay, my dear, what direction do we go from here?”​
​“We want to go northeast. Let me get my compass out.” He reached into his pocket​
​and took out the trusty compass that had once been his father’s; the one he had​
​50​

​counted on since he was a young boy. Lillya believed in it, too, for it had gotten​
​them this far.​
​“Why don’t you tell us, my dear,” Anton said.​
​Lillya tied her hair back in a bun, pretending it wasn’t even there, and then said to​
​Anton, “Turn left. I, too, can smell the leather from the Kungur factories getting​
​near.”​
​Lilly and Anton knew so much depended upon what would happen this day. Would​
​Michael and his friends be there looking for them as her father had promised,​
​Lillya wondered. Or would he have taken her father’s money and found he had​
​better things to do than wait for a cousin he hadn’t seen in forty years who had​
​nothing to offer him but trouble and stories from the past? Anton questioned​
​whether Michael’s loyalty was strong enough and whether he was brave enough to​
​show up at the church every night for weeks on end, waiting for his cousin and her​
​husband to arrive, when he hadn’t seen her since she was a child. Anton prayed​
​that he would recognize her. But with the dimple in her chin and her perfect slanted​
​nose Lillya had no doubt that this Englehardt would recognize another.​
​Drenched in the last of what could be called summer sunlight, they continued​
​toward Kungur. A sly smile appeared on Lillya’s face. Anton didn’t want to know​
​the reason why. He could feel his wife’s heart pounding harder the closer she​
​51​

​thought they were to their destination. Wrapped up in his own thoughts, he was​
​caught completely off guard when suddenly, a boulder came rolling down the hill​
​aimed right where they were riding. Luckily, Anton had quick reflexes and was​
​used to acting on instinct just as he had been taught to do since childhood. He​
​urgently grabbed the horse’s reins and pulled them hard and quickly got them out​
​of the boulder’s path. Lillya didn’t know what was happening until she felt Anton​
​give her shirt a swift tug, changing her direction and speed and she suddenly heard​
​the sound of a giant boulder rolling past her. When it was over, she froze and stood​
​there shaking. It took a minute or two for her to register just how close she had​
​come to dying. Anton had just saved her life. Standing next to Lillya, he was​
​shaking, too. The boulder had gotten very close to its target. It might have been just​
​a fluke of nature, but Anton had to think of himself as a soldier leading the cavalry,​
​and his job was to deliver his precious cargo safely, without a scratch if possible.​
​Anton didn’t really want to know who or think what was behind this close call,​
​their near mishap. He wanted to make light of it and didn’t want Lillya to become​
​more frightened than she already was. Putting on his best face, he looked at Lillya​
​with a grave expression and said to her, “Man can plan all he wants, but Nature is a​
​force that has its own mind and it is always going to do what it pleases and will​
​roar as loud as it wants and cause as much havoc and hardship as will fill its​
​stomach.”​
​52​

​Lillya replied, “But luckily, my dear, I have you. Nature doesn’t know the will and​
​the force I have at my side!”​
​Anton had simply reacted. He hadn’t had time to think. Lillya slowed her breathing​
​and began to normalize. Silently, her composure returned, and her green eyes​
​began to sparkle and color returned to her cheeks and one could see the natural​
​beauty of her youth. She wanted Anton to know she had relaxed. That they could​
​go forward. Anton, wanting to break the hardened air that had entered the circle​
​surrounding them, decided to tell a joke. Lillya loved that he was trying to make a​
​joke during such a serious time. For only moments before, getting to Kungur could​
​have been the least of their worries.​
​Anton knew how to focus more than anything else. Nothing could break his​
​concentration when he had somewhere to go and something to do, and in this​
​moment it was to see a smile on his wife’s face. So, he continued. The Austrian​
​clown Leo told him a funny story. Amused, Anton smiled to himself when he​
​realized the coat Lillya was wearing had once been Leo’s wife’s coat. He had​
​talked to Anton about the art of illusion and how sometimes it could be more​
​powerful than the truth. And he spoke about a clown who had tried to win the one​
​and only position with a circus, but the circus had advertised that they were​
​looking for a clown who could ride a unicycle and they were interested in no​
​others.​
​53​

​The clown was so determined that even though he could not ride it, he bought a​
​unicycle and made it very visible to the owners. And because they saw the bike,​
​they did not question whether the owner knew how to ride one. He had only used it​
​as a prop, an illusion, so he would appear more useful and the circus would hire​
​him. But in reality, his finest skill was sticking a mop between his legs and running​
​around in circles as if it were a donkey who had lost his mind and didn’t know​
​which way to go. Mimicking a costumed mop to look like a donkey got more​
​laughs, anyway. With a unicycle one needed skill, a mop you just needed​
​imagination, to be able to move your limbs and be funny and give the audience​
​room to laugh. That’s what jokes are about. Giving the other space and time to find​
​something funny.​
​Lillya, not wanting to admit that she had been shaken, suggested that they stop for​
​a short period of time. They could sip some Bergamot citrus tea just like the Czar​
​would be doing at this hour had he not been summering on the other side of the​
​mountain range where they would soon take refuge. Anton, fearing that the large​
​stone could have come from a misplaced soldier out for revenge, or simply wanting​
​to steal their horses, urged Lillya on by talking about the boar they might eat that​
​night, the feast they might have.​
​54​

​“I need a safe place where I can read my father’s journal, without drawing attention​
​to myself,” she thought. In her mind she was going over the directions her father​
​had given them.​
​“Enter the back entrance of the church when the parishioners are leaving after the​
​evening service is complete. In all that commotion it is less likely anyone will​
​notice you. Still, you must be very careful.”​
​They had fared fairly well. Their supplies had lasted and soon they would be​
​among friendly company and have the underground support of a nearby church and​
​a few of their most trusted members who would help them to hide. Just thinking of​
​it, Lillya started to feel the butterflies in her belly. She could barely wait to be​
​around trusted company and sit at a proper table, drink wine and converse. Simply​
​allowing these thoughts brought back memories of her father, and she wondered if​
​he was still alive. Her father, she suspected, would be in his study waiting for the​
​soldiers’ arrival, and whether they be the Red or the White he would let them know​
​it was his patriotic duty to give up his estate to and for the people. Then if they​
​were Red he planned on shouting “Comrade,” and if they were White, he would​
​offer up his very best wine.​
​Her father knew nobles that kept 300,000 serfs. “What family needs such excess?”​
​Behind closed doors Lillya recalled a conversation with her father earlier that year.​
​“They got too greedy,” he continued. “And now if they leave, they most likely​
​55​

​leave with nothing. If they are lucky and smart they hid some of their family​
​jewels. One necklace could buy them passage to America and keep them alive. I​
​hope you didn’t send every last emerald and ruby to the States and remembered to​
​keep a few for yourself and Anton.” She listened attentively but said not a word.​
​Lillya found solace in knowing their affairs with the circus and their home had​
​been settled before their world turned completely upside down. Thank goodness​
​Anton and her father were forward-thinking men. Together they had made​
​arrangements for her son Vladimir in the United States, more than enough to assure​
​the legacy of his family and the circus.​
​Anton came from a long line of circus people and he had inherited his family’s​
​circus which was located near the Bolshoi in St. Petersburg, but that was many​
​years ago. He had since given the circus to his son, who took the circus from​
​Russia to Europe, then made a home in the southern United States traveling from​
​one town to the next. But it was Lillya, it was her pedigree the armies would be​
​most interested in. She was the reason they were running.​
​Anton and Lillya tried not to think about what had just happened. The boulder that​
​fell had scared her, but Anton was sure-footed. Even so, he wondered, was it a​
​random act of violence, was it some bored kid playing some sort of game or was it​
​a displaced soldier from the Red or White army hoping that if he brought back​
​several horses and two prisoners that he might once again return to their good​
​56​

​graces? Lillya could see the thoughts jumping around in Anton’s head but she​
​knew better than to ask him, for it would only stir things up and make them feel​
​worse. They should just be grateful that nothing happened to them or their horses​
​or even the displaced boy; after all she had a son and would hope that any mother​
​would look at these almost children and think of their own progeny as well when​
​making decisions. She quickly changed the subject and surprisingly found herself​
​speaking of Donatalia, the daughter of her old friend Katya from whom she had​
​learned this tea recipe. Katya was the first person who had ever made it for her​
​many years ago. For just a few seconds she could see this young girl dressed in her​
​New Year’s best, trying not to have the son of their hostess notice she was counting​
​her forks and spoons. Trying very hard to act grown up. She could see Donatalia​
​unable to contain her excitement as Anton told one story after another. Anton was​
​in rare form that night, Lillya remembered. Standing in the open so close to where​
​the boulder could have so easily taken her life. Anton didn’t know if his joke about​
​the clown had worked, but he was certain that something he had done or said had​
​triggered the smile that now appeared on her face. Lillya brought herself back to​
​where they were standing and to that exact moment in time. Visions of ice castles​
​and princesses and elephants carrying a cage disappeared when she heard her​
​husband’s voice break through the chatter that was going on in her head. “I think​
​57​

​it’s time we get back on the horses,” Anton said. “We’ve indulged in too much time​
​already.”​
​“You won’t find any disagreement here,” Lillya answered back. “I’m more than​
​ready and my feet are, too.”​
​58​

​New chapter Lillya and Natasha getting older​
​Yuri could hear giggling coming from Lillya’s room. Lillya had convinced her​
​father to put another bed in her room for the night so she and Natasha could live​
​out their dream of being sisters. Lillya’s father had begun to worry because he​
​knew the truth of their situation; that their class difference would very soon​
​become a problem. He could shelter them as children but soon it would not be so​
​easy. Natasha would not be invited to any of the parties and events that Lillya​
​would attend, and he assumed that after a while it was going to bother Natasha to​
​dress up her best friend to go to parties while she had to stay home and clean up the​
​mess they had made in the process of getting dressed. But the one thing Yuri didn’t​
​take into account was just how left out Lillya felt when all the girls would talk​
​about their mothers. They would chatter about outings with their mothers, going​
​for tea or to the seamstress. Lillya really missed Angelina and wished Angelina’s​
​special job had been to just take care of her. Did the angels really need her so​
​badly?​
​Soon winter would be over and Lillya’s father had arranged a grand vacation for​
​the coming summer. He had decided that they would go to France. Besides the​
​glamor of being in France, Lillya knew that not too many girls her age were given​
​this opportunity and that it gave her something they did not have, even if they all​
​had mothers. Sadly, Natasha would not be coming with them. Her father had​
​59​

​explained that she would have a young French girl helping her with the language,​
​her clothing, the culture, her manners, and by the end of her time there, he told her​
​she would know the difference of what was good or bad, for the French were the​
​trendsetters of the world. What they said set the bar for everyone else.​
​Quietly, Yuri had thought it a good idea to begin to separate the girls without them​
​understanding it was planned. He didn’t really like the idea himself, but culture and​
​class systems were going to dictate all of their lives and so he thought taking his​
​daughter on an extended vacation might be a good start. He could think of no better​
​or kinder exciting idea than this. Yuri went on to bait Lillya, knowing her love of​
​horses, “There’s a very famous cavalry school in the Loire Valley, in the town of​
​Saumur, where we will be staying.” Then he winked at her and finished, “If you​
​mind your manners and are very good, perhaps I will find a way to arrange a tour​
​for you?” He knew when he said this it would heighten his daughter’s curiosity and​
​then she would do almost anything he wanted.​
​“Boys and horses and a famous riding academy,” Lillya silently thought. “Hmm.”​
​She had to be careful not to let the smile in her eyes take over her face. “Tell me​
​about this journey you have planned for us,” Lillya smiled mildly. Yuri had rented​
​the east wing of a Chateau in the southwestern part of France from a man named​
​Sergei who also had a great interest in horses and cultivated a small vineyard from​
​which he made his own wines. “The Chateau was built by a famous architect.​
​60​

​Sergei will be able to tell you the story in more detail, but unlike many of the​
​homes in that area, this one is full of light. Sergei loves to paint when he has the​
​time, and light is important to him, as is being on the water,” Yuri went on. “There​
​are very few characteristics one’s house needs to have in order to qualify as a true​
​Chateau. Here is that one exception.” Yuri paused and held his breath until he was​
​certain Lillya was sitting on the edge of her seat, her body all tense waiting to hear​
​about something large dramatic, exotic and extraordinary. “This has to be wrong,”​
​she thinks.​
​“The house must rest on the Loire River or one of its tributaries,” Yuri finally spit​
​out with much certainty. Yuri always felt more disappointed in himself when he​
​disappointed his daughter. “Its beauty has attracted many artists and many nobles​
​have been drawn to the area like magnets. King George of France found its beauty​
​so intoxicating he moved the entire capital of France from Paris to the Loire Valley.​
​Besides, all the nobles were already traveling to the region during the summer and​
​spending their vacations there. He just made it a little easier for them to do so.”​
​“I believe Sergei had his house fixed from top to bottom in the late 1860s, so it is​
​up to date.” Yuri smiled, “You’ll like this; it still has a small moat and a​
​drawbridge.” Yuri continued, “I’m told it has Belgian and Flemish tapestries​
​covering many of the walls, and many other beautiful pieces of art, including some​
​of his own paintings.” He sighed for a minute before continuing, “I think it sounds​
​61​

​like a picture from one of your favorite fairy tales,” Yuri told his daughter. “You’ll​
​like it! But best of all, he has an unusually fine stable of horses. I believe the​
​location will appeal to your imagination, heart and soul. There are a number of​
​castles in this region. They were built as fortresses a long time ago, when they​
​were needed to keep the gentry safe. But now they are used to house very wealthy​
​families, and their horses are used for breeding, races, and contests; pleasure, not​
​fighting. You’ll see.” Then he turned around as if he were planning to move on to​
​something else but couldn’t stop himself from going on. “Some of my favorite​
​grapes are grown there.” Yuri stopped for a moment, “I wish I could just count to​
​ten and we’d be there.”​
​In late March, before their scheduled trip to France, her father finally got around to​
​making a date for them to go see the Vronsky Family Circus. Lillya was beside​
​herself.​
​“I can’t believe how excited I am,” Lillya said to Natasha. “I’m finally going to see​
​that son of theirs that no one has introduced me to. They’re not going to get away​
​with that tonight, I’m going to insist they introduce us and if I like him I’m going​
​to make Papa promise to invite him to see our stables. I’m told his name is Anton.​
​Can you imagine going out with a boy that walks a high wire!”​
​62​

​That night Lillya wore her favorite blue lace dress with a blue and yellow scarf to​
​match. It was the color of the sea at sunset with embroidered golden threads​
​running through it and burnt orange threads intertwined to accentuate the gold that​
​looked like the sun setting on the sea. She hoped her father would like Anton as​
​much as she thought she would. “Maybe he’ll invite him over to ride next​
​Sunday?” She loudly mumbled to Natasha, trying to swallow a bite of her dinner at​
​the same time. She could barely keep her food down. Butterflies were flying so​
​rapidly in her stomach, fluttering at such a pace, she didn’t know if she could keep​
​her composure. It was as if her stomach was their designated migrating ground,​
​only the action was not between one tree and then another, but instead inside of​
​her.​
​When Lillya got nervous Natasha liked to tease her, but this time she understood​
​the importance of this event for Lillya.​
​The circus tent was teal blue and burnt orange with a big bright gold sign that lit up​
​the sky and it read,​​The Vronsky Family Circus​. Located​​near the Bolshoi, everyone​
​in St. Petersburg knew where to find it. Dimitri and Petra Vronsky had arranged a​
​special place where Yuri and Lillya might park their carriage. Petra and Dmitri​
​seemed to be almost as excited as Lillya and Yuri. They knew that if Yuri and​
​Lillya spoke highly of the circus, more aristocrats and members of the upper class​
​63​

​would follow their lead. It would also help to keep them in the good graces of the​
​Czar and Czarina. They were escorted to the best seats in the house, front row and​
​center, which had been draped with a beautiful purple fabric adorned with stars and​
​hearts of gold and deep ruby reds. Lillya noticed all the eyes in the tent were​
​staring at her and she couldn’t help but admit to herself that she liked it and was​
​glad she had taken the extra time getting dressed for the event. Caught in a web of​
​her own thoughts, when the tigers entered the arena she smiled at the foolishness of​
​thinking she could possibly outshine the natural beauty of their coats. They were​
​wearing the most striking silky fur she had ever seen and the audience seemed to​
​compete for their attention quickly and naturally turned from herself to them. Her​
​eyes had become fixated on the circus and nothing else, and she had an instant​
​uncontrollable pining to be a part of it. “What magnificent creatures!” Lillya said​
​to her father, poking his elbow until he listened to her. She already had a special​
​affinity for them, having heard Petra speak of them at dinner. “Their names are​
​Midnight and Satin,” she said to him as if she had been the only one who had heard​
​the conversation. And just at that exact moment their trainer brought them within a​
​breath of their proximity. Midnight opened his mouth as if to show off his​
​prize-winning sharp teeth. Satin, attached to Midnight, came so close to them that​
​Lillya felt as if she could almost touch her. And quicker than she could process​
​what had just happened, in walked the elephants. Lillya had never seen such big​
​64​

​creatures. And at the top of one of the elephants, dressed in purple satin, was Petra,​
​whose arms, though long, were unable to wrap around the big elephant’s neck.​
​After several tricks and a roar of applause from the audience, Petra quickly​
​changed clothes and entered the ring playing a flute while standing upright on her​
​horse’s saddle with a big red feathered plume popping out of the deeper red thick​
​satin headband. Lillya smiled at her father. Petra’s outfit was a bit risqué but she​
​was so brilliant in her moves and the way she commanded her horse that no one​
​could refer to her as cheap or inappropriate. They could only stare at her in​
​amazement and awe.​
​Then the moment arrived. Twenty-five feet up in the air was the boy she had​
​admired from conversation. She had never seen him. A little shorter and stockier​
​than she had thought for such a position, but seemingly cooler than she imagined​
​possible for someone about to embark on such a treacherous feat. Her heart started​
​to rattle and shake so loud she was afraid her father might hear it. By the time he​
​started juggling plates and had walked to the other side, she was already on her feet​
​giving a standing ovation. Realizing how anxious she must look, she sat down.​
​That night when the circus ended, Petra Vronsky arranged a little table to be put​
​into one of the smaller tents and invited Yuri and Lillya to join them for some​
​Schnapps, Vodka and pastry. The tent had a nice golden glow that comforted​
​Lillya. Still, she was a bit nervous and her father knew it. “Only a sip,” Yuri​
​65​

​reminded Lillya. “Just wet your lips.” Earlier, Yuri had teased Lillya, saying that he​
​had told Petra they couldn’t come because it would be too late for his daughter.​
​Lillya turned beet red and just about burst until she realized her father was joking.​
​It turned out Lillya was the opposite of shy when it came to Anton Vronsky. Her​
​tongue wiggled and waggled one sentence, paragraph, page after another. “He was​
​so easy to talk to,” she told Natasha later that evening. “I’ve never talked to​
​someone as smart as he that was close to our age. I think I might be in love.”​
​Natasha had a pot of chamomile tea waiting for their return, knowing she would​
​have to calm Lillya down. “Why are we going to stupid France,” Lillya said later​
​that night to Natasha.  She knew she didn’t mean it. Any girl would give her​
​eyeteeth to have a summer in France, walk the Champs-​Élysées​,​​visit the Cadre​
​Noir in Saumer, live among the castles most others would visit, for the Loire​
​Valley was known to have some of the largest and most beautiful Chateaux in the​
​world. “The one summer I would want to stay home, father insists we go, and he’s​
​not about to change his plans!” Natasha could not feel sorry for Lillya. Oh, how​
​she wished she could go in her place. But that night when Lillya closed her eyes,​
​the only one she could see was Anton. Hypnotized by his confidence and talent, he​
​was throwing one plate and then another higher and higher.​
​Natasha could hear Lillya tossing and turning. She was made happy by Lillya’s​
​excitement and joy but she couldn’t help think about where all of this might leave​
​66​

​her. Was this the beginning of what she knew one day would come? What she had​
​been so fearful of coming? And Lillya would turn sixteen while in France, without​
​Natasha by her side.​
​The next morning when Natasha went downstairs to get Lillya’s breakfast, she​
​noticed that flowers and a note had already been dropped off for Lillya. She could​
​only guess who they were from. But just then, Yuri walked into the kitchen. An​
​unusual thing for him to do. He had noticed the flowers, too, and could imagine​
​what Natasha was thinking.​
​“You know these are not from Anton,” Yuri told Natasha. Almost feeling he was​
​betraying his daughter, he whispered, “These are from Petra.” This made the two​
​of them even more curious.​
​Yuri followed Natasha up the steps with Lillya’s breakfast, the flowers and the​
​note. When they walked into Lillya’s room after first knocking and Lillya saw the​
​flowers on her tray, before she had a second to open her mouth, Yuri blurted out,​
​“Isn’t this lovely? You got flowers and a note from Petra.” You could see the​
​disappointment immediately cross Lillya’s face. However, all three in attendance,​
​including Lillya, knew that if anything was to go any further it would have to start​
​with the parents, and in her case it would have to begin with the boy’s mother.​
​“Why don’t you open the note, my dear,” Yuri said as Natasha handed her some​
​fresh juice. “Dear Lillya,” it read. “Dmitri and I and Anton were so pleased to have​
​67​

​had your company last evening. We know that when it comes to animals, you love​
​horses most of all, so I hope the circus did not bore you.” Lillya interrupted and​
​looked at her father and Natasha and said, “how could anyone be bored by the​
​circus, it was the most fabulous show I have ever seen.” Lillya paused for a second​
​and went on, “I could have given each of them two standing ovations! They were​
​magnificent, weren’t they Papa?” Natasha coughed into her hand then picked up​
​the note and said politely, looking at Lillya and Yuri, “May I continue? There’s​
​more.” Petra invited Lillya to go riding with her. Lillya could pick out any horse​
​she wanted from their stable to ride that day. And she wanted to know if Lillya​
​could be available to ride two days from the current day. Lillya’s head was about to​
​burst once more and before Yuri could express his thoughts, his daughter penned a​
​short note saying yes, yes, yes!​
​Lillya couldn’t wait for the day to come. She played games with Natasha, letting​
​her win just so Natasha would keep playing and she could keep her mind occupied.​
​She picked flowers and arranged them in beautiful vases, then brought out her​
​watercolors and painted in a little sunroom off of the kitchen until the light left the​
​sky and she could barely see, and when it got too chilly, she relocated to the dining​
​room window, close to the large stone fireplace. She was certain she would see​
​Anton again. When she thought of him, chills rippled like a cool spring stream up​
​and down her spine.​
​68​

​Natasha helped Lillya get dressed for Petra. She put on a beautiful pale yellow​
​dress that had a scarf that went with it that was stamped with purple orchids. Lillya​
​loved orchids. For Anton, she had Natasha gather flowers from the gardener in the​
​greenhouse and put the flowers in her hair. When she was about to walk out the​
​door to grab some air so she would look fresh when Petra’s carriage arrived to take​
​her to their stable, a rider unexpectedly approached the house asking for Lillya. He​
​was carrying a note. It was from Anton. “Dear Lillya,” it said “I am sorry, but I​
​have been called away to answer business directed at my father. I’m sorry we will​
​not have a chance to formally get together before I leave. Today is the day I have to​
​go. I’m afraid it may be some time before we have another opportunity to​
​exchange thoughts and ideas. My mother has explained to me that you will be​
​leaving for France before my return. I find it sad that timing could get so in the​
​way of discovering who you really are. This may be quite forward of me, but I’m​
​wondering if you would meet for a few minutes right now? I know it won’t be for​
​very long.” The expression on Lillya’s face completely changed and she began to​
​read silently, keeping the words from Anton between only the two of them. “Could​
​you meet me in five or ten minutes behind your father’s barn? I can’t bear the​
​thought of not speaking to you before I lose you to the horses and boys of France.”​
​69​

​Lillya then looked at Natasha with pleading eyes, then showed her the note. “Will​
​you help, Natasha?” Lillya asked. Natasha, knowing Lillya’s stubborn streak, and​
​that Lillya would go with or without her, nodded her head yes.​
​Lillya’s father was back in his library working away, so Lillya had a short window​
​of time to do as she pleased, but she knew she’d better move fast. Natasha ran to​
​grab Lillya’s hand and together they quickly ran behind the barn paying no​
​attention to the stable boys. Several minutes later, Lillya could hear footsteps​
​coming up from behind. Trying to remain calm, she took a breath and then three​
​others. Natasha took both her hands into her own and just that action alone helped​
​her heart retain its normal beat. Not knowing what to say when Anton arrived, she​
​simply remained silent. Lillya and Anton shyly embraced. Lillya knew his​
​thoughts. She knew he would wait for her while she was in France. Quickly, he​
​kissed her on the cheek, a typical French greeting, but his lack of words told her​
​everything. Then he turned towards her with a big smile on his face, jumped on his​
​horse and left.​
​Lillya tried to take a step forward but almost fell back. Then she looked at Natasha​
​and said, “It’s a good thing I don’t walk the rope.” Natasha started laughing and​
​gathered Lillya’s things and together they headed back toward the house. Lillya’s​
​head was spinning. “He kissed me,” she whispered. “He kissed me!” When Petra’s​
​carriage arrived she was much more silent than she would have normally been. Her​
​70​

​head was somewhere else as she played that last scene with Anton over and over as​
​if they were rehearsing the final scene of a play in a theater. Petra, a smart female,​
​sensed the feelings behind Lillya’s demeanor and said to herself, “I have no doubt​
​my son had something to do with this.”​
​71​

​New Chapter​
​The scare with the boulder left both Lillya and Anton tense. They didn’t have​
​much farther to go, but anything could happen. Anton tried to remind himself of​
​this each step that they took and tried to remind Lillya too, without being too pesty.​
​He told her, “Probably only four or five hours more to go before we arrive at​
​Kungur.” Kungur was their final destination, for now at least. Still, he didn’t want​
​to get Lillya’s hopes up too high. The closer they got, the harder their journey​
​seemed to become. It felt almost impossible. Lillya didn’t know time could move​
​so slowly. But looking at the sun and the way it was positioned in the sky and the​
​speed they were traveling, Anton felt fairly certain they would make it. Besides, he​
​couldn’t bear the thought of his wife sleeping outdoors for one more night.​
​Lillya had put on a good face. She didn’t want to show Anton how frightened she​
​had been by many of the obstacles they encountered along the way, especially the​
​boulder. Yet she couldn’t stop her mind from thinking what could happen if they​
​were found out. She felt guilty for having gotten Anton into this upper-class​
​cauldron of trouble. She thanked God for having made her a woman for the worst​
​that would happen to her would be prison, but a man would most likely be sent to​
​the front lines and certain death.​
​“Besides, what would they want with me?” Lillya had created numerous internal​
​conversations with many imaginary people since they left. It made sense since​
​72​

​there was nothing to do but to walk and talk. Each step they took was bringing​
​them closer to a new life, like it or not. However, Lillya had made up her mind to​
​make the best of it. “What else can I do?” she said. Out of nowhere, a bolt of​
​lightning lit the sky and thunder shook the earth. She tried to think of what horrible​
​deed had been done to make God so angry. She was certain it was a man’s doing.​
​“We don’t need this,” Anton said out loud, seeming to try to make up for the​
​mishaps of his gender as rain the size of pennies fell from the sky.​
​Lillya was upset because the rain was ruining the game she had made up to keep​
​her mind occupied. She liked to guess how many steps they had taken since the last​
​time she added them up, but for now the rain was rinsing them away. The footsteps​
​had been witnesses to their journey and the rain was erasing the evidence of all her​
​hard work. So instead she found herself becoming transfixed by the sounds of the​
​little bubbles that were popping underneath her feet as the rain made its way into​
​the earth.​
​It felt childlike making up games like this, but she had had to find a different way​
​of dealing with time and learning patience along the way. The stakes were too high​
​to be playing make-believe. For the gameboard of life her father and the other men​
​set up meant there was no time for frivolity, this was life and death!​
​Anton knew he had no choice but to trust the plan that Lillya’s father had set up for​
​them with Michael. By now they were in too deep and no one else, friends or​
​73​

​relatives, seemed to owe her father a bigger favor, a favor of the magnitude of what​
​they’d be asking Michael to do. Walking in the rain, the sound of the little bubbles​
​continued popping under her feet. When Anton had estimated they were about an​
​hour from Kungur and the church, Lillya reached into her bag and pulled out an old​
​scarf to tie around her head. She’d be able to tuck her hair inside of it, covering up​
​most of her gray and helping her to disguise her true identity. They started to see​
​other travelers on the path going in the opposite direction. Lillya wondered why​
​they were leaving but didn’t dare try to venture into any sort of conversation or​
​recognition more than a nod.​
​Testing his memory, Anton began to recite Yuri’s instructions to the church. “You​
​will go to​​the lower part of the town,” her father​​continued. “On Kittarskaya Street​
​is the Uspenskaya Church. Your mother’s cousin is friends with the parish priest.”​
​He repeated them over and over until finally the church came into view. Both​
​became more cautious as they inched in closer to their final destination. Lillya​
​grabbed her husband’s hand, unable to anticipate what would happen next. The​
​congregation was chanting a familiar song from Lillya’s childhood (find name of​
​song). Lillya was about to whisper something to Anton when he put his finger to​
​her mouth, signaling her to be quiet. “Shh,” he said to his wife. “We must stay very​
​quiet, my love. Michael will find us.”​
​74​

​Lillya bit her tongue. Anton motioned for her to stay put. He left to check out their​
​surroundings.​
​Lillya wasn’t too pleased. Happily, Anton returned a few minutes later with news.​
​“There’s a big brush of blackberry bushes close by.” And he pointed to the left​
​where there was an old gardening shed. “I think that will provide some cover this​
​time of day,” he said after seeing a questioning look in Lillya’s eyes.​
​“The hymn, the one they’re singing, I sang it as a girl.” She smiled, hoping to​
​lighten the mood. “It was our closing hymn. No time to deliberate. I think we’d​
​better get ready because the congregation will charge through that front door very​
​soon.”​
​<add material here>​
​Anton and Lillya found their way to the blackberry brush by the shed.​
​“Do you think Michael will be here tonight?” Lillya asked.​
​“I don’t know, my love, but if not he will have sent someone in his place. Don’t​
​worry. He’s going to take very good care of you. Of that I am sure!”​
​Anton had tried to keep his own questioning to himself, afraid that the power of​
​doubt would prove him right.​
​“Anyway, there is no turning back.” Anton said softly. He noticed an old beggar​
​out of the corner of his eye. The beggar nodded in recognition. Anton just ignored​
​him.​
​75​

​Anton gave Lillya a peck on her cheek to assure her. “Everything’s going to be​
​fine,” he whispered and squeezed her hand. Wanting in some way to acknowledge​
​how far they had come, Lillya lightly kissed him on the lips.​
​Lillya and Anton’s intimacy did not stop the beggar from coming closer. The old​
​man motioned to Anton, wanting them to move closer to him. But Anton and​
​Lillya stayed put. For a second, Lillya drifted to thoughts of her son Vladimir. She​
​wondered how many obstacles he had had to cross to make his new home. And for​
​a second; for a minute would be too painful, she imagined her granddaughters,​
​whom she had never had a chance to meet.​
​“How horrible,” Lillya thought, “that men and politics break up so many families​
​by starting wars.” But when thinking of Vladimir, she felt a sense of satisfaction,​
​for she believed they had done what was necessary to ensure that he and his family​
​were safe.​
​The people from the church scattered. A few went behind the church where Lillya​
​and Anton were. Lillya heard coughing from behind them. She jumped and made a​
​small jerky motion. Hoping no one noticed her, she turned only to see the beggar.​
​Lillya decided to pay him no attention. Her sights were on someone else.​
​The parishioners in front of the church said their final goodbyes and left for home​
​as the pain of fright mixed with abandonment kicked her in the belly. The beggar,​
​the only one vying for their attention, became annoying.​
​76​

​Anton whispered into Lillya’s ear, “He might have had other things to do tonight.​
​It’s not as if he was given a specific date of our arrival. He’s probably been outside​
​this church the last three nights and decided to take a break, and didn’t want to​
​appear more religious than he is?” Anton tried to reassure his wife. “We’ll wait a​
​little longer, but if he doesn’t show up tonight, don’t lose faith, my dear. Your​
​father would never put a plan in motion that involved your life without almost one​
​hundred percent certainty that it would work out.  If necessary, we will have to go​
​back into the forest for one more night.”​
​Anton could see the sadness on her face; the disappointment of no reward, when​
​suddenly the parish priest approached them with the beggar at his side.​
​Without wasting a breath, he introduced himself, then instructed the beggar to take​
​over the reins of Anton and Lillya’s horses and to follow him. All Lillya and Anton​
​knew was that they needed to listen. The parish priest was the key to their future.​
​They walked down a dark, small dirt lane and eventually stopped in the back of  a​
​carriage house that looked like all the others they had passed, only this one had a​
​small cross embedded in the wooden door, allowing them to enter the premises.​
​Lillya noticed a small lantern lit in the window and a strong green vine that was​
​growing up the sides of the structure as if to frame the building like a painting.​
​Lillya took a step back to take in the broader view. Upstairs looked to be a place​
​where people could sleep and live and downstairs was clearly a place to rest their​
​77​

​horses and belongings. “We can talk inside,” the priest said softly. “And pardon​
​me, by the way, my name is Nikolai.” Finally, Anton and Lillya knew the name of​
​the parish priest.​
​“You will be quite comfortable here and out of the way,” the priest continued.​
​“Still, always take the back road when you are coming and going. Your cousin​
​Michael will come here in the morning with his wife Gretta and my wife Helena.​
​His house is down the street, but you will be safer here, staying with me in our​
​home,” he said directly to Anton. “No one would dare question or disturb the​
​parish priest. Your husband will be known as my cousin,” he continued saying.​
​Lillya had not realized before now, seeing the priest in the soft lantern light, how​
​young he was. “How brave is he,” she thought, “for helping his friend Michael’s​
​family.”​
​“There are some clean blankets on the bed,” he said when they had climbed the​
​steps and entered the door to what would be Anton and Lillya’s new home. It was​
​small and simple, but clean and cozy, and it had one small window with a table and​
​chair in front of it that would gather the southern light. Lillya smiled when she saw​
​it. Anton, seeing Lillya happy, smiled too. “There is fruit and bread and a hard​
​piece of meat that you can cut. We weren’t quite certain when you’d arrive.​
​Michael will be happy to receive this news. I will see you in the morning.” Anton​
​78​

​thanked the priest, gave the beggar some change and went back upstairs to help his​
​wife settle in.​
​79​

​New chapter​
​“My dear, you’re quite a rider. I knew you were talented, but I didn’t realize you​
​were better than me,” laughed Petra. Lillya and Petra were returning the horses to​
​Petra’s groom. The groom spoke out, “You rode ‘em hard, Miss Petra. He’s going​
​to need a good brushing today.” He winked at Lillya, “You didn’t have anything to​
​do with this, did you?”​
​“No, I would never ride a horse so hard.”​
​“Oh no, not you,” the groom said with a smile.​
​Petra looked at Lillya and the groom and started to laugh.​
​“I think, Ivan, there might be a new member of the circus one day soon.” Ivan,​
​besides being a groom by day and overseeing the stables, got to perform at night​
​swallowing fire. Yes, he was the fire eater and loved learning new tricks, but he​
​practiced those far away from the stables and simply talked to the horses about his​
​accomplishments but never showed them what he could do.​
​Lillya was flying as high as a kite when she got back home. She barely said hello​
​to him when she ran up the stairs about to burst, yelling for Natasha. “His mother’s​
​amazing!”​
​“Calm down, Lillya, calm down. I’m certain she’s wonderful, but we have all night​
​to discuss her.”​
​80​

​Lillya, with a sullen face, walked out. She was terribly disappointed that Natasha​
​didn’t seem to take her crush on Anton as seriously as she did.​
​Natasha was playing with the nightclothes in Lillya’s closet and was deliberately​
​making a lot of noise to cover up the sound of Lillya’s happy voice. Lillya had​
​been gone all day enjoying something while she had stayed home cleaning out the​
​bathtub. She knew it was her duty, but when would that change?​
​In truth, Natasha had actually had quite a bit of fun while Lillya was out, but she​
​didn’t want Lillya to know it. For a few moments it was better, Natasha thought,​
​for Lillya to think that she had stayed home lonesome and bored, but it was far​
​from the truth. Lillya’s father Yuri wanted to surprise his daughter and had hired​
​one of the best French seamstresses in all of St. Petersburg to make some new​
​dresses for her to take to France, and the seamstress had asked for one more fitting.​
​Instead of sending Lillya, her father had sent Natasha.​
​The dressmaker, like anyone dealing with the upper crust of Russian society, spoke​
​only in French to Yuri, assuming Natasha, a maid, would not know a word of the​
​aristocratic language spoken amongst themselves, meant to help separate the​
​working classes from the elite. Natasha smiled when Yuri winked at her, for with​
​her photographic memory she had memorized all of Lillya’s studies throughout the​
​years, including her almost perfect French accent.​
​81​

​For several hours Natasha could almost believe this was her life, that of the​
​mistress and heiress instead of a handmaid. The dressmaker and Yuri left the room​
​to discuss fabric and prices. Natasha caught a glimpse of herself in a large silver​
​plate and gave herself a big smile of approval. Yuri returned with fabric in one​
​hand, but in his other hand he now carried a box filled with jewels.​
​You can pick one for yourself he told Natasha and one for Lillya.​
​Out of loyalty and love, Yuri noticed she picked the nicest piece for his daughter.​
​By the time dinner was through, both Lillya and Natasha had let go of their​
​artificial disappointments in the other. Besides, Lillya would be leaving for France​
​in one week’s time.​
​Natasha knew that she would be missing her best friend and Lillya felt the same​
​way. Natasha was like her sister and she couldn’t imagine being without her for​
​any length of time and she couldn’t get Anton off her mind. “He was so bold,” she​
​thought. “He came to my father’s home, asked me to meet him secretly and gave​
​me a kiss.”​
​Without a mother to help raise his daughter, Lillya understood that her father had​
​become more open-minded than many fathers. He wasn’t trying to hold himself up​
​as the example of Russian society. After all the sadness he had seen his wife​
​endure, he wanted nothing more than happiness for his daughter. Educated by some​
​82​

​of the best French teachers in all of St. Petersburg, she had been tutored and raised​
​to fit into society, and therefore Natasha secretly believed, so had she.​
​He branded her with his lips, Lillya reflected on Anton. She couldn’t get the​
​feelings and what they meant off of her mind nor wash it away. She wanted some​
​distraction. She wanted some laughter and fun.​
​Natasha felt a bit worried for Lillya because she could read Lillya’s sparkling green​
​eyes and they were saying trouble. Lillya had no inkling of the foreshadowing​
​Natasha saw because she was at a point and an age in which nothing was taken too​
​seriously, and little was more than a game until it wasn’t.​
​***​
​The French had infiltrated Russia with their art, their dance, their drama and their​
​food by now. Although the Russians were getting stronger in their dance it was​
​hard for anyone to beat the French, but it didn’t stop the world from trying.​
​Her father set up reservations on an ocean liner (what kind of ship would it be?)​
​Yuri’s planned trip was suddenly in competition with young love and he found​
​himself describing the beauty of where they would be traveling as if he were a​
​famous French painter wanting to entice a museum or a buyer. “One of the most​
​famous Chateaux in the Valley: Chateau de la Chance.  It sits on the bank of the​
​Layon River and was built in the 11​​th​​century and​​flowers and artichokes line the​
​83​

​river, as do beautiful grape vines that are later pressed into some of my favorite​
​wines.”​
​“Mm” Lillya said with a big approving smile on her face. Yuri knew he would not​
​have to work very hard for his daughter’s approval on where they would be going​
​and with whom they would be staying.​
​The difficulty would be in separating his daughter from Natasha and this new​
​blood and excitement she found jiggling inside her senses. She could see that her​
​father was even more excited than she was to be taking this trip. It was the place he​
​felt he belonged more than anyplace other than his own home. He saw the land, its​
​rich beauty and perfect soil, as a part of himself. It was in his blood, the marrow of​
​his bones, and this connection acted like a carrier pigeon, programmed to always​
​bring him home. But when Lillya’s mother was still alive, she made him promise​
​that he would never abandon their Russia and he would always do whatever was​
​necessary to keep Lillya there, steeped in Russian culture and heritage.​
​Lillya was overwhelmed by the stories of the beauty and largeness of these French​
​castles her father described and the many others that had been built in this region.​
​She had seen wealth before, but the way her father described the natural passion​
​and joy these people seemed to possess, they sounded magical.​
​The French had influence in Russia from art to architecture and became the​
​standard bearers on what was considered good. So, any young Russian girl would​
​84​

​be more than thrilled to be able to experience the culture and to say that she walked​
​the Champs-​Élysées​​in Paris and that it was more beautiful​​than she could have​
​imagined.  Even though their destination would be Saumur, Yuri knew that he had​
​to plan their transportation to include a short stay in Paris, too.​
​There were two ways of luxury travel between St. Petersburg and the Loire Valley,​
​and Yuri decided he would indulge his daughter in both. They would take a luxury​
​suite in a steamship to the Loire Valley, passing through the Baltic Sea and then​
​going around Denmark, eventually landing in the French Port of Bordeaux. There​
​he would have a caravan of stagecoaches waiting to take them to their final​
​destination of Saumur, home of the famed equestrian academy, the Cadre Noir.​
​Lillya found that she preferred land over sea. Her stomach gurgled constantly and​
​her father carried a bucket and walked beside her, but she enjoyed herself​
​nonetheless and enjoyed daydreaming in her suite.​
​With each breath Lillya took, St. Petersburg seemed to be farther away and their​
​house in St. Petersburg, which had always been considered large, would soon feel​
​small.​
​Lillya and her father arrived at the Chateau d’le Chance just as the women were​
​finishing airing out the rooms, each one more beautiful than the last. Exotic​
​85​

​lanterns adorned the home with their frescoes of engraved tulips that Lillya would​
​discover let off a deep dripped oil of golden yellow that in its center almost looked​
​orange. Tulips seemed to be in every room and on the grounds they were going to​
​inhabit.​
​Lillya couldn’t help but think about the story of the man who swallowed a tulip​
​bulb, not realizing its worth. Lillya felt sorry for the man who had been made a​
​fool of.​
​There was laughter echoing from the dining room when Lillya and her father​
​arrived. Then two little boys who were playing tag and hide-and-seek using large​
​marble statues and a giant marble vase to shield themselves came tromping in.​
​They had no idea that their playground was at all unusual until their father walked​
​in and reminded them to mind their manners. “Silence!” he barked. “I promised​
​your mother I’d teach you to behave.” Yuri and Lillya found the situation funny.​
​Sergei, the children’s father, had wanted to make a nice impression on the father​
​and daughter who had come such a distance to rent the east wing of his Chateau for​
​the following few months. Still, he knew his boys had charm enough to win over​
​any crowd, let alone that of a tired teenaged girl who had been cooped up on a ship​
​for days, no matter how luxurious their suite was.  “What’s that dirt you have on​
​the bottom of your pants and on your shirt?” their father asked. “I’m certain Vanya​
​86​

​will be quite disappointed – she put a lot of care into dressing you this morning.”​
​But clearly the little boys carried no guilt or fear.​
​Sergei winked at Vanya as she entered the room.​
​Having heard Sergei, she chimed in, strengthening their father’s case. “Yes, your​
​father’s right, you make me so sad that I could almost cry.” Vanya exaggerated her​
​movements and the tone of her voice to pretend she was quite serious.​
​Taking Vanya seriously, Aleksi and his little brother Stassi apologized.  And from​
​this opening moment, Lillya knew that these two sweet boys would liven up her​
​stay in France.​
​Lillya smiled and said hello, then followed her new handmaid Anika up the stairs​
​where a bath had been drawn and was waiting for her. The water had been heated​
​in big cauldrons over the fire and was mixed with ice cold creek water from behind​
​the house to get just the right temperature. While she was bathing, Anika pulled out​
​little sacks of lavender that she had made in anticipation of Lillya’s arrival. After​
​putting them in Lillya’s drawers when she removed Lillya’s clothing from each of​
​her suitcases, she smiled with a look of great satisfaction, for this was the first step​
​towards helping Lillya not only speak French but smell French like all the other​
​girls in her class.​
​Lillya figured Anika was probably only ten years older than herself, and even in​
​her work clothes you could see she had a nice figure.​
​87​

​When speaking French, Anika’s vocabulary and the way she put her words​
​together was far superior to her own facility of the language. Someone had taken​
​the time to educate her, for she spoke English and Russian too. Clearly Anika was​
​more than a handmaid. “I could learn a few things from these French girls,​
​especially this one,” Lillya said to herself.​
​Lillya made it a part of her daily routine to ask Anika questions about herself, such​
​as if she was married or had a boyfriend. And Anika made a point of teaching​
​Lillya the finer points of escargot, duck cooked in plum sauce, but mostly how to​
​carry the scent of lavender wherever she went. Every night, Anika put out a bowl​
​of lavender and little bags to the side, for Lillya had become fond of making her​
​own little bags, and if she didn’t get around to it, Anika made certain there was one​
​in each of Lillya’s drawers when she woke up in the morning. “Now you’ll smell​
​like a real French girl,” she would smile, and Lillya couldn’t help but smile back.​
​Anika slowly introduced her to all of the different rooms in the house. One sitting​
​room with a big oak desk and stained glass cut windows was dedicated to the style​
​of Peter Carl Faberg​é​, a Russian jeweler of French​​descent. The artist, unable to​
​replicate the exact working of this famous artist, decided to make a wall clock and​
​titled it “For Faberg​é​​Time Will Tell It All.” It​​reminded Lillya of St. Petersburg.​
​“The east wing of the Chateau”, thought Lillya, “Father and I will live quite well​
​here.”​
​88​

​Though many miles from home, Anton became the picture Lillya saw when she​
​closed her eyes at night. “Anton had something special,” Lillya wrote Natasha, and​
​she imagined the crowd cheering as he tossed plates into the air with each step he​
​took. But Lillya had large ambitions of her own. She was a daring young woman​
​and boys sought out the chance to catch a glance of this special girl.​
​Anton cursed his parents privately for sending him away just as he was meeting the​
​one girl that he thought could make him happy.​
​There were many boys who had much more to offer than Anton Vronsky, as far as​
​society was concerned, but Lillya’s fear of heights when she saw him at the top of​
​a rope made her want him more, for he had conquered her greatest fear. Lillya and​
​her father would be gone a long time, and she wondered if some other girl might​
​capture his imagination in her absence. Natasha had reassured her that would be​
​impossible. “There’s no one more interesting or talented than you!” and she​
​believed it, so Lillya did, too.​
​And then there was the food. Escargot and pheasant and later the pear tartes. How​
​would she describe all of this to Natasha? Oh, how she wished she could come,​
​too. How would she explain the temperament of the people or why they serve so​
​many courses in one meal? And breakfast, they call it petit d​é​jeuner. Why,​
​according to Papa, there is nothing small about it.​
​“Oh,” thought Lillya, “it’s so different!”​
​89​

​With all this beauty, luxuries, and delicious foods, it doesn’t seem to calm the​
​people from getting high-strung or having passionate arguments in all their​
​conversations right in the middle of dinner. “Not because they are angry, but​
​because they feel strongly about something,” her father explained.​
​“They seem to have an uncanny internal clock to tell when the raspberries and​
​crème​​brûlée​​is about to be served, because they are​​always smiling by the time​
​dessert is in the air,” her father continued. “They don’t seem to fight, really, they​
​just value good, hearty conversation.”​
​Lillya began to imagine what the next months might bring and the more she​
​thought of the present, the smaller the past became. It’s not that she loved Natasha​
​a lesser amount, it was just that there were so many new things around her to think​
​about and the culture was so different that she couldn’t help but get distracted.​
​Lillya had been given a prized horse to ride for the duration of their stay. She was​
​told he was named Whisper because of the way he galloped down a path always​
​quiet and smooth. And they liked the sound of this English word and its​
​translation, too.​
​In the Loire Valley, you could actually smell the land as it flew off of his hoofs.​
​Yuri and his friends sat in the library and drank and played cards at night. Lillya​
​was certain he was having a good time. “I wonder what kind of life he leads when​
​we’re asleep at night in St. Petersburg,” she wrote Natasha. “I think he’s too​
​90​

​handsome and probably too full of life to have kept to himself all these years. I​
​wonder why I never gave him credit for being more than a father. To me he’s just​
​Papa. But for the first time, I’m seeing that he’s more than that to others. And I​
​guess it’s only in this land of romance and passion that I can even think about my​
​father in this way. It just makes me question everyone, even myself.”​
​91​

​Kungur Chapter Arrival - continued​
​Anton was out taking care of the horses when two women approached the carriage​
​house gently knocking on the door. “My name is Helena,” one said. “Nikolai is my​
​husband. I’ve brought you a few things for the house. This is Gretta, Michael’s​
​wife.” Lillya smiled and opened the door. The women kissed Lillya on both cheeks​
​as was the custom, and Lillya responded by introducing herself.​
​“Why, I would have recognized you anywhere,” Gretta smiled. Michael is right -​
​an Englehart wears their family crest on their face,” and the three women laughed.​
​“We came to help you get settled in.  I know it is not what you are used to and last​
​night had to be difficult and somewhat confusing, but we have all had to adjust to​
​the times,” Gretta sighed.  “I also brought you some bergamot tea,” Helena smiled.​
​“It’s our way of saying prayers for our county and the Czar and his family and it​
​reminds us of better days. And it’s our way of welcoming you.”​
​Gretta was tall and very striking-looking with thin lips and a long dark brown mane​
​of wavy hair. Lillya was surprised how little gray she had for a woman of her age.​
​Helena was plainer, but pretty in her own way. The sky was beginning to change its​
​mood from blue-gray to a crisp golden orange. Gretta pulled out some​
​delicious-looking morning biscuits. Lillya caught the scent of fresh baked grains​
​and the smell of cinnamon.​
​92​

​“You know, I met you as a child. I was younger than you are now. Michael, my​
​Michael, had quite a crush on your mother. He thought the world of her. Yuri, your​
​father, took it in stride. I think he was used to it. Oh, I’m sorry. I’m speaking to​
​you, a single woman forgetting that the mother is always the mother. Your mother​
​was quite confusing. No one felt they could compete with her in any way. My​
​husband made a fool of himself sometimes.”​
​“This is going to be a happy reunion,” Gretta jumped in.​
​Lillya smiled, wondering, though, how Michael’s wife really felt about taking such​
​risks with their lives and she began to think about all the secrets her father had​
​obviously kept. What secrets would his journal reveal about them all?  This woman​
​who was Michael’s wife, a cousin by marriage, whose name was Margretta​
​Villanova until she became an Englehardt. Could she be the key? What she did not​
​know?​
​“Let me boil some water for us to steep the wonderful black tea you brought us.”​
​Gretta pronounced.​
​“My husband and Michael should be here soon.” Helena broke in.​
​“And Anton is anxious to meet you both.” Lillya added.​
​93​

​Margretta’s nickname was Gretta. Older than Lillya, she still had maintained a​
​good sense of humor and zest for life and love even though she, like Lillya, had​
​lost much of what she’d thought would be hers. Lillya could see that these women​
​might become new friends. Oh, how happy Lillya was to hear voices other than her​
​own and Anton’s. She loved her husband dearly, but she was in need of other​
​companions and the sound of stories, laughter that only other people could bring​
​with them and in return they could retell interesting stories and events their circus​
​employees and entertainers had shared with them. Surely, they had enough​
​interesting stories from the circus to last most people two lifetimes. Unfortunately,​
​with strangers, that’s what they would have to share, but who knew what the future​
​would bring? She and Anton needed to hear other opinions; it gave them a source​
​of conversation and debate and livened up their nights.​
​By the time Nikolai and Anton returned to the house, the women were chattering​
​away about a celebration they wanted to have that evening. Anton handed Lillya a​
​small bouquet of wildflowers he had picked along their way back. “I thought you​
​might like these, my dear,” he said as he handed them to her.​
​Anton and Nikolai began to store the goods they had collected and the women​
​slowly began turning the carriage house into a home.​
​Michael walked through the door, the main attraction as far as Lillya was​
​concerned. Lillya found him surprisingly jubilant, especially considering their​
​94​

​situation. Not an ounce of fear showed on his face. Not a clue that he could be​
​involved in a scheme of hiding aristocrats.​
​“Lillya,” he smiled, as if it had only been months since they last saw each other​
​“It’s been too long and how is that father of yours? He was always my favorite​
​relative. But then again, he was the one who won the heart of Angelica. Quite a​
​feat. She truly was an angel on earth! Born to do things we couldn’t even​
​understand.” Lillya tried to take it all in without showing her feelings. She gave​
​him a brief, sad, recent history of her father and tried not to tear up too much.​
​“I like to think that he’s still at home, walking his horse, carrying a bottle of his​
​favorite wine at his side, there with Stephano his houseman to keep him company​
​and to listen to his stories at hand. But truthfully, I don’t know if he is alive or​
​dead.  And Lillya welled up as if she were a ten-year-old girl and it greatly​
​embarrassed her. “I believe the creaky sound of the old wooden floors in our house​
​must be helping to keep him company. And he’s very good at having conversations​
​with himself.”​
​“But today is a joyous occasion. We must be grateful for these moments we have.”​
​Michael said in deep reflection. “No one knows how many more we have left or​
​what tomorrow will bring,” he said thinking of all the friends he had lost, while​
​remembering the reasons he should remain in a grateful frame of mind.​
​95​

​“You are right cousin I promise not to be so solemn at dinner tonight.” And with​
​that Lillya gave him her best Engelhardt smile.​
​***​
​“The parish priest, Nikolai, is a generous soul, and he has been paid well to​
​maintain it. However, no one is truly safe. That said, I think you should be​
​comfortable; certainly much safer than if you had stayed with your father.” I hope​
​you’ll send my regards to him when the opportunity allows.  He is a good man who​
​has had to rise above much sadness—your mother—but you and I will have plenty​
​of time to talk about that another time. It upsets Gretta, and right now you want her​
​on your side.” Lillya didn’t quite understand what her cousin meant. She took a​
​deep breath.​
​“Nikolai and I have established a very loyal congregation and he has told them that​
​his uncle was coming to stay for a while, so people will welcome you with open​
​arms and not apprehension, gossip, or mystery.”​
​Lillya opened the windows to get some air inside the house and to blow away some​
​of the intrigue and mystery. A nice swift breeze came through and sprinkled the​
​scent of Kungur leather that had slipped in through the cracks.​
​“It’s been a long hard journey” Lillya finally said. “I look forward to hearing​
​stories about my mother. I was very young when she passed away. For now,​
​though, I believe I need a nap.”​
​96​

​Michael kissed her on both cheeks, as did the priest’s wife and Gretta. He and​
​Anton hugged a deeper hug than normal for they knew within this gesture they had​
​made a promise to take care of one another’s family. A gesture from which there​
​was no turning back. If one got caught aiding and abetting the enemy, the other one​
​did, too.​
​Lillya wanted to feel worthy of the favor her father had asked. She felt quite sure​
​that her father had already fulfilled his end of the request many years prior for, he​
​was not one to ask others for help. Except his houseman Stephano to whom he had​
​been paying a lofty monthly sum and more.​
​What is the secret they are both keeping? Lillya wondered about her father and​
​Michael. He must have something on her cousin. But what? She closed her eyes​
​and tossed and turned her way to sleep​
​97​

​New Chapter​
​Herv​é​​Laurent Fleury was a plain sort of fellow that​​had worked all his life to make​
​himself big. If he was given a lesson that would normally take two hours, he would​
​take four to six hours of study to make certain when called upon that his answer​
​would be perfect.  His dress was always impeccable, and he studied the dictionary​
​so in conversation he could throw out a word or two to display his intelligence and​
​aptitude.​
​Laurent, as most people called him, also loved horses and he worked just as hard to​
​become a master at that as he did with everything else. When he wasn’t studying to​
​perfect his person or appearance, he was at the chateau of a captain at the Cadre​
​Noir who had discovered this overachiever of a boy in an orphanage nearby and​
​decided he would be a very good worker.​
​There was never a son and fatherly relationship among the two, but a deep respect​
​of each one’s skill when it came to horses, so the man kept Laurent on and clothed​
​him and fed him and one day suddenly surprised him with a scholarship to the​
​famed academy.​
​Laurent took this opportunity like he took everything else; seriously, and thus he​
​rose in the ranks until it was clear that someday he would equal his patron savior.​
​However, one day while training the horses, his patron savior had a heart attack​
​and died, leaving Laurent nothing but himself and his position at the academy, for​
​98​

​which he was grateful. Laurent showed a very bright future. The only thing​
​missing was love and a wife. Then one day, while riding in the woods near the​
​creek, he saw a streak of lightning ride past him.  Not certain what it was, he​
​returned to the exact same spot the following day in case the mystery decided to​
​repeat itself. Being the kind of person who left little up to chance, he observed his​
​surroundings like any good soldier would. He noted to his left stood a large tree​
​that had been damaged in a recent storm and behind it a patch of beautiful wild​
​roses that had found a home amongst the dandelions and brush. But the greatest​
​impression of all was the scent of the flowers that lingered in the air and the sound​
​of the water rushing behind him.​
​The next morning when he returned, a beautiful girl with shiny red-golden hair and​
​emerald eyes, dressed in bright red silks was standing upright on her horse’s back​
​and she flew past him like a flaming arrow with a gigantic smile on her face​
​carefree and happy. She blew him a kiss. Laurent almost fell off his horse!​
​“She’s the most wondrous creature I’ve ever seen,” he moaned over and over to​
​himself. “I must meet her!” he exclaimed.​
​Having to work overtime, which for years had been no problem for him, that​
​weekend Laurent sadly went to do his duty and fulfill his obligation at the​
​academy. He had been given the job of showing yet another wealthy man around​
​99​

​the academy. “Don’t they see enough horses?” Laurent sighed to himself out of​
​fear that if he didn’t return to that exact spot this morning the girl would think that​
​he wasn’t interested, which could not have been further from the truth. Still, he​
​took pride in his work and appearance for by now it was who he had become. But​
​when the wealthy man arrived, a man from the academy approached Laurent to let​
​him know that the man had brought his daughter. “He says she is very interested in​
​riding, so you might need to slow your pace and cater it a bit toward her as I​
​believe that is what would make this man happy.”​
​Just at that moment, a swirling girl dressed in yellow, gold, and red entered the​
​stable with her father.​
​“This is Yuri and his daughter Lillya.” The squint in Laurent’s eye examining if​
​what he was seeing was the truth could have told one hundred tales. Every fantasy​
​he ever had seemed to come true when he saw this girl.​
​Laurent took several breaths, then escorted Yuri and Lillya into the manège where​
​stood some of the most beautiful horses Lillya had ever seen. Although the cadet​
​was very distinguished-looking, he seemed a bit tongue-tied at first until he began​
​to display the very French upper crust form of horse ballet of which he was a​
​master.​
​Lillya’s father whispered to her, telling her that very few horsemen around the​
​world knew this special art as well as this cadet did.​
​100​

​Laurent knew that this was his time to shine. The girl certainly would be captivated​
​and would have difficulty keeping her eyes on anyone or anything else other than​
​him.  “Thank you, father,” Lillya whispered back to Yuri. “Coming here has been​
​worth it if only for this.”​
​Yuri, feeling quite pleased with himself, asked the cadet if he would like to come​
​over to the Chateau where they were staying and go riding with him and his​
​daughter sometime soon.​
​Laurent could not believe how lucky he was to have been the one chosen to give​
​Yuri and Lillya the tour, and he quickly obliged. The rest of the day, Laurent could​
​do nothing but brag, which was not his usual custom. “Did you see that girl?” he​
​asked every cadet he could talk to.  “She’s going to be my wife,” he repeated over​
​and over.​
​Lillya, when she got back to the Chateau, immediately ran to the stables and took​
​out Whisper.​
​“You are going to learn some special tricks this summer,” she smiled.  For the rest​
​of the afternoon until almost sunset Lillya schooled the horse until Yuri made her​
​come back inside. “I’m going to see Laurent tomorrow, and you can’t say no,​
​Papa.” And he knew she was right. “He’s going to teach me this secret art of horse​
​ballet that very few men know.  Just think what the aristocratic women will do​
​101​

​when I show them this!” Yuri didn’t want to think about it because his daughter​
​was a force to be reckoned with when she made up her mind.​
​Lillya could barely contain her excitement.  She had heard of the fine art of​
​dressage and had actually seen one master once with her father when he took her​
​with him to pick out a stallion.  There was a French man with a beautiful chestnut​
​stallion who had been taught this sacred art. Lillya knew how privileged she was to​
​have been able to tag along with her father and she knew better than to pester him​
​or his invitation would vanish as quickly as it had appeared.  “You will look, listen,​
​observe and be quiet,” her father said, “and nothing more. Are you able to do​
​that?”​
​For days before, she practiced the art of silence, the most important and difficult​
​one for her.  So, when Laurent came along four years later and she was four years​
​older, Lillya felt that she was more than ready to be schooled by him and by this​
​time she had become a masterful rider herself.​
​“Don’t get too serious with this Laurent,” her father said after several days.  And​
​then he reminded her that she was in France to perfect her French and to get to​
​know lots of French girls and boys, not just one.  “Don’t worry, Papa. He doesn’t​
​think of me that way. Besides he’s very polite and has never tried to force himself​
​on me.” But Yuri knew men and he knew that they didn’t always say what they​
​truly thought.​
​102​

​“You know that I’ve gone to all the dances I’ve been invited to, and when I get​
​home, I’m going to set my intentions on Anton Vronsky. He’s the person I want to​
​marry!” Lillya liked to get her father all riled up. But it was true for Lillya. Ever​
​since meeting Anton, she could think of no future better or brighter than being in a​
​circus, and she had never met a boy more exotic or kind.  “No, father, no worries​
​about me staying in France and marrying Laurent. That would put me a sea and an​
​ocean away from you and the man I will one day love. I couldn’t bear being away​
​from the two of you, let alone Natasha!  I like him very well, but he’s not the one​
​for me, you’ll see.” And she said goodnight, thinking about Anton while counting​
​her horse’s steps, because if she could, she wanted to do this art as perfect as him.​
​****​
​Since coming to France, Lillya had gotten into the habit of borrowing Whisper​
​every morning. She also got into the habit of seeing Laurent daily. She was​
​surprised to discover in herself that there was something about the French that​
​made her feel free and all warm inside and it wasn’t just because she was living in​
​the middle of a vineyard or that her father let her sip wine at meals as she watched​
​the others drink by the carafe. Lillya felt French passion seemed to be a happier​
​passion than the daunting sadness described in most Russian stories, paintings,​
​music, dance and poems. It made her want to be more free, and sometimes with​
​103​

​Laurent she found herself becoming someone else, a girl less shy and more​
​expressive than the girl she had been all of her life.  Yes, she still rode like​
​lightning and could light up the nighttime sky, and there were many from the​
​opposite sex both old and young taken by her, but she had held herself back. When​
​she was with Laurent, she could see in his eyes that he was falling deeply in love​
​with her without telling her or expressing any words. Lillya began to frighten​
​herself, for in this foreign world she was beginning to feel this way too. Then one​
​evening, as he helped her off her horse, his hands got tangled in the garlands in her​
​hair and as he gently pulled them out, he found his hands lightly touching her face​
​and surprising not only her, he leaned in and kissed her. Then he pulled back and​
​looked into her eyes and could see that she liked it and, wanting her so badly, he​
​did it again, only this time for twice as long. “Will you be mine?” he asked her.​
​“We can spend our lives riding through the breeze and dancing on the shore. I​
​promise you will be happy for it is all that I want in this world.”  Lillya was​
​shocked and excited at the same time.  No man had ever spoken to her like a grown​
​woman before. So enamored by the moment was she, she sighed, “Yes, my love,​
​yes, yes!” But by the time the second “Yes,” slipped off her tongue, Lillya could​
​already feel the gravity of her actions and yet she was conflicted by how tingly she​
​felt inside. And Laurent, hearing her breathe and putting his hand on her chest to​
​104​

​make certain that the pounding heartbeat was hers, went from a knight to becoming​
​a king, for the young woman he just kissed could be nothing less than a queen.​
​When they left to part their separate ways home he kissed her again; just long​
​enough and hard enough to make her question herself and she left him dizzy and​
​confused.​
​When she returned to the Chateau, her handmaid could tell something was wrong​
​just in the way Lillya was avoiding her father. She immediately asked for a bath,​
​almost demanded it, as if she wanted to wipe something off of her. The handmaid,​
​trying to be nice to Lillya, instead made her cry. “Pourquoi pleurez-vous?​
​Dites-moi,” she asked. And Lillya spilled her story of her infatuation with Anton​
​and her embarrassment of getting carried away with Laurent. “How will I ever be​
​able to explain this to the man I believe to be my true love? He pulled out this blue​
​velvet box before I left, and he slipped it into my own pocket. I didn’t know what​
​to do. It all happened so fast.” And Lillya began to cry even more. “I’m afraid to​
​open it by myself.  Will you stay here while I do?” and her handmaid nodded a​
​simple ‘yes’ reply with her head.​
​Unbeknownst to them both, Yuri had followed Lillya in, and when he could hear​
​that she was upset, he stayed outside her door and listened to her as she cried her​
​heart out, wishing he could wrap his arms around her like he did when she was a​
​little girl. Instead he did the only thing he felt a good father could do. He walked​
​105​

​next door, apologized for pulling Sergei from his dinner and they went into the​
​library where they could have some privacy and talk father to father.​
​Yuri said not a word to Lillya, and better than that, he asked no questions. He did​
​what he felt he should do to not throw dirt on either the young man or his young​
​daughter. But as the morning sun began to peep its head through the panes in​
​Lillya’s bedroom, a groggy headed young woman was put into a carriage with big​
​feather pillows where she was served breakfast dumplings as her father said his​
​goodbyes to Sergei and they pulled away as suddenly as they had arrived. Soon​
​they would be in Paris and on a train to St. Petersburg as if they had never gone.​
​Lillya never saw Laurent again, but he saw her. However, she remembered the​
​many mornings and teachings he had so freely given. She pictured herself on top of​
​Sergei’s horse Whisper and in her head went over the ballet step by step that​
​Laurent had taught her until it became a part of her, because even in her present​
​state of mind, she was not so far gone that she was unable to see its value to her in​
​the world.​
​On the long trip home, when she was certain she was all alone, she opened the box​
​that Laurent had so gently placed in her pocket. Inside was a short note that read,​
​“To Lillya, the flame of my life. You sparkle brighter than any emerald or ruby.​
​May this always be yours and you be mine.”​
​106​

​Years later, Lillya passed the brooch to her good friend Katya, a beautiful ballet​
​dancer, as she felt it was better to have it out of her hands. Katya, in turn, gave it to​
​her daughter Donatalia, a very talented young ballerina who Lillya could still​
​imagine when she shut her eyes the way Donatalia looked in her light lavender​
​gown the night she danced with Lillya and Anton’s son Vladimir on the lawn at the​
​Winter Palace for the Czarina Alexandra. Donatalia’s father was so proud and​
​happy. The only true sadness was that Katya had passed away and was not able to​
​join in the celebration. Lillya could understand how Donatalia felt, for on​
​occasions like this she still missed her mother, too. Still, Lillya was certain they​
​were there with them, giving Donatalia the ability to fly each time Vladimir lifted​
​her in the air as if she were only a feather.​
