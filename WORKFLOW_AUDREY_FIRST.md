# Workflow: Prioritizing Audrey's Original Material

## Core Principle

**The primary goal is to use as much of Audrey Berger Welz's original material and original intent as possible.** All other material (AI-generated, ghost writer additions, suggested edits) should be clearly distinguished and attributed.

## Workflow Steps

### Step 1: Extract Audrey's Original Material

**Goal:** Identify and extract only Audrey's authentic writing from all available drafts.

```bash
python3 extract_audrey_material.py
```

**What it does:**
- Analyzes all manuscript versions
- Identifies material that appears in Audrey's original drafts (prioritizing the version sent to Tyson Cornell)
- Excludes material from ghost writer versions (v69, v73, or versions marked "GW")
- Compiles a clean version of only her original work

**Output:**
- `manuscripts/Shadow_of_Lillya/audrey_original/audrey_original_compiled.md`
- Metadata about sources and paragraph counts

### Step 2: Edit Audrey's Material for Clarity

**Goal:** Make minimal edits to Audrey's work to improve clarity while preserving her voice.

```bash
python3 edit_audrey_material.py
```

**What it does:**
- Loads Audrey's extracted original material
- Applies minimal edits:
  - Fixes obvious typos
  - Normalizes spacing and punctuation
  - Preserves all voice, style, and word choices
- Creates a clean, readable version

**Output:**
- `manuscripts/Shadow_of_Lillya/audrey_edited/audrey_edited_clean.md`

**Important:** This step makes NO content changes - only clarity improvements.

### Step 3: Generate AI Completions (Optional)

**Goal:** Create AI-generated continuations that are clearly marked as such.

```bash
python3 llm_completion.py --model openai --model-name gpt-4
```

**What it does:**
- Uses Audrey's original material as context
- Generates continuations that attempt to match her style
- Saves completions with clear metadata

**Output:**
- `completion_attempts/[model]/completion_[timestamp].md`

**Note:** These are clearly marked as AI-generated and will be kept separate from Audrey's material.

### Step 4: Compile Final Manuscript with Attribution

**Goal:** Create a final manuscript that clearly distinguishes all material sources.

```bash
python3 compile_final_manuscript.py
```

**What it does:**
- Combines Audrey's edited material (Part I)
- Adds AI-generated sections (Part II) with clear attribution
- Includes suggested additions (Part III) if any
- Creates clear section breaks and attribution notes

**Output:**
- `manuscripts/Shadow_of_Lillya/final_compilation/shadow_of_lillya_final.md` (full version)
- `manuscripts/Shadow_of_Lillya/final_compilation/shadow_of_lillya_audrey_only.md` (Audrey's material only)

## Material Classification

### ✅ Audrey's Original Material
- Extracted from her draft manuscripts
- Prioritized from version sent to Tyson Cornell (March 2020)
- Includes earlier unedited versions
- **Excludes:** Ghost writer versions (v69, v73, GW versions)

### 🤖 AI-Generated Material
- Generated by LLMs using Audrey's work as context
- Clearly marked and attributed
- Used only to complete the narrative
- Never mixed with Audrey's original material

### ✏️ Suggested Additions
- Material suggested by editors or contributors
- Clearly marked and attributed
- Complementary, not replacement material

## File Organization

```
manuscripts/Shadow_of_Lillya/
├── audrey_original/          # Step 1: Extracted original material
│   ├── audrey_original_compiled.md
│   ├── compilation_metadata.json
│   └── source_*.md
├── audrey_edited/            # Step 2: Edited for clarity

```

## Principles

1. **Audrey's Material First:** Her original writing takes absolute priority
2. **Clear Attribution:** Every section is clearly labeled with its source
3. **Voice Preservation:** No changes to Audrey's voice, style, or word choices
4. **Transparency:** Readers can see exactly what is Audrey's and what is not
5. **Minimal Editing:** Only clarity edits, no content changes
6. **Respect for Original Intent:** Honor Audrey's vision above all else

## Quality Checks

Before finalizing, verify:
- ✅ All of Audrey's original material is included
- ✅ No ghost writer material is mixed with Audrey's work
- ✅ All AI-generated sections are clearly marked
- ✅ Attribution is clear and accurate
- ✅ Voice and style of Audrey's sections are preserved
- ✅ The manuscript structure honors her original intent

## Next Steps

1. Run the extraction to identify Audrey's core material
2. Review and edit for clarity (minimal changes)
3. Generate AI completions if needed (clearly marked)
4. Compile final manuscript with full attribution
5. Review to ensure faithfulness to Audrey's work
